,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"The preservation of animal and plant life, and of the general beauty",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"of Nature, is one of the foremost duties of the men and women of",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"to-day. It is an imperative duty, because it must be performed at",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"once, for otherwise it will be too late. Every possible means of",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"preservation,--sentimental, educational and legislative,--must be",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
employed.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"The present warning issues with no uncertain sound, because this great",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"battle for preservation and conservation cannot be won by gentle tones,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
nor by appeals to the aesthetic instincts of those who have no sense of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"beauty, or enjoyment of Nature. It is necessary to sound a loud alarm,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"to present the facts in very strong language, backed up by irrefutable",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"statistics and by photographs which tell no lies, to establish the law",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
and enforce it if needs be with a bludgeon.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
This book is such an alarm call. Its forceful pages remind me of the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
sounding of the great bells in the watch-towers of the cities of the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Middle Ages which called the citizens to arms to protect their homes,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
their liberties and their happiness. It is undeniable that the welfare,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
and happiness of our own and of all future generations of Americans are,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
at stake in this battle for the preservation of Nature against the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"selfishness, the ignorance, or the cruelty of her destroyers.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"We no longer destroy great works of art. They are treasured, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
regarded as of priceless value; but we have yet to attain the state of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"civilization where the destruction of a glorious work of Nature, whether",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"it be a cliff, a forest, or a species of mammal or bird, is regarded",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
with equal abhorrence. The whole earth is a poorer place to live in when,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
a colony of exquisite egrets or birds of paradise is destroyed in order,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"that the plumes may decorate the hat of some lady of fashion, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
ultimately find their way into the rubbish heap. The people of all the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"New England States are poorer when the ignorant whites, foreigners, or",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
negroes of our southern states destroy the robins and other song birds,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
of the North for a mess of pottage.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Travels through Europe, as well as over a large part of the North",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"American continent, have convinced me that nowhere is Nature being",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
destroyed so rapidly as in the United States. Except within our,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"conservation areas, an earthly paradise is being turned into an earthly",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"hades; and it is not savages nor primitive men who are doing this, but",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
men and women who boast of their civilization. Air and water are,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"polluted, rivers and streams serve as sewers and dumping grounds,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
forests are swept away and fishes are driven from the streams. Many,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"birds are becoming extinct, and certain mammals are on the verge of",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"extermination. Vulgar advertisements hide the landscape, and in all",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"that disfigures the wonderful heritage of the beauty of Nature to-day,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
we Americans are in the lead.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Fortunately the tide of destruction is ebbing, and the tide of",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
conservation is coming in. Americans are practical. Like all other,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"northern peoples, they love money and will sacrifice much for it, but",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"they are also full of idealism, as well as of moral and spiritual",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
energy. The influence of the splendid body of Americans and Canadians,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
who have turned their best forces of mind and language into literature,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"and into political power for the conservation movement, is becoming",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
stronger every day. Yet we are far from the point where the momentum of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
conservation is strong enough to arrest and roll back the tide of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
destruction; and this is especially true with regard to our fast,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
vanishing animal life.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The facts and figures set forth in this volume will astonish all those,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
lovers of Nature and friends of the animal world who are living in a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
false or imaginary sense of security. The logic of these facts is,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"inexorable. As regards our birds and mammals, the failures of supposed",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
protection in America--under a system of free shooting--are so glaring,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
that we are confident this exposure will lead to sweeping reforms. The,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
author of this work is no amateur in the field of wild-life protection.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
His ideas concerning methods of reform are drawn from long and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
successful experience. The states which are still behind in this,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"movement may well give serious heed to his summons, and pass the new",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
laws that are so urgently demanded to save the vanishing remnant.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"The writing of this book has taught me many things. Beyond question, we",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"are exterminating our finest species of mammals, birds and fishes",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
_according to law!_,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
I am appalled by the mass of evidence proving that throughout the entire,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"United States and Canada, in every state and province, the existing",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
legal system for the preservation of wild life is fatally defective.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
There is not a single state in our country from which the killable game,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"is not being rapidly and persistently shot to death, legally or",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"illegally, very much more rapidly than it is breeding, with",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
extermination for the most of it close in sight. This statement is not,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
open to argument; for millions of men know that it is literally true. We,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
are living in a fool's paradise.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The rage for wild-life slaughter is far more prevalent to-day throughout,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the world than it was in 1872, when the buffalo butchers paved the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
prairies of Texas and Colorado with festering carcasses. From one end of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"our continent to the other, there is a restless, resistless desire to",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"""kill, _kill!_""",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
I have been shocked by the accumulation of evidence showing that all,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
over our country and Canada fully nine-tenths of our protective laws,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"have practically been dictated by the killers of the game, and that in",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
all save a very few instances the hunters have been exceedingly careful,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"to provide ""open seasons"" for slaughter, as long as any game remains to",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
kill!,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"_And yet, the game of North America does not belong wholly and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
exclusively to the men who kill! The other ninety-seven per cent of the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"People have vested rights in it, far exceeding those of the three per",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
cent. Posterity has claims upon it that no honest man can ignore._,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
I am now going to ask both the true sportsman and the people who do not,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"kill wild things to awake, and do their plain duty in protecting and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"preserving the game and other wild life which belongs partly to us, but",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"chiefly to those who come after us. Can they be aroused, before it is",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
too late?,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"The time to discuss tiresome academic theories regarding ""bag limits""",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"and different ""open seasons"" as being sufficient to preserve the game,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
has gone by! We have reached the point where the alternatives are _long,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
closed seasons or a gameless continent;_ and we must choose one or the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"other, speedily. A continent without wild life is like a forest with no",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
leaves on the trees.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"The great increase in the slaughter of song birds for food, by the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"negroes and poor whites of the South, has become an unbearable scourge",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"to our migratory birds,--the very birds on which farmers north and south",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"depend for protection from the insect hordes,--the very birds that are",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
most near and dear to the people of the North. _Song-bird slaughter is,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"growing and spreading_, with the decrease of the game birds! It is a",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
matter that requires instant attention and stern repression. At the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
present moment it seems that the only remedy lies in federal protection,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"for all migratory birds,--because so many states will not do their duty.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"We are weary of witnessing the greed, selfishness and cruelty of",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"""civilized"" man toward the wild creatures of the earth. We are sick of",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
tales of slaughter and pictures of carnage. It is time for a sweeping,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Reformation; and that is precisely what we now demand.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"I have been a sportsman myself; but times have changed, and we must",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"change also. When game was plentiful, I believed that it was right for",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
men and boys to kill a limited amount of it for sport and for the table.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
But the old basis has been swept away by an Army of Destruction that now,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"is almost beyond all control. We must awake, and arouse to the new",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"situation, face it like men, and adjust our minds to the new conditions.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The three million gunners of to-day must no longer expect or demand the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
same generous hunting privileges that were right for hunters fifty years,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"ago, when game was fifty times as plentiful as it is now and there was",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
only one killer for every fifty now in the field.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The fatalistic idea that bag-limit laws can save the game is to-day _the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"curse of all our game birds, mammals and fishes!_ It is a fraud, a",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
delusion and a snare. That miserable fetish has been worshipped much too,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"long. Our game is being exterminated, everywhere, by blind insistence",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"upon ""open seasons,"" and solemn reliance upon ""legal bag-limits."" If a",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
majority of the people of America feel that so long as there is any game,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
alive there must be an annual two months or four months open season for,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"its slaughter, then assuredly we soon will have a gameless continent.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The only thing that will save the game is by stopping the killing of it!,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"In establishing and promulgating this principle, the cause of wild-life",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"protection greatly needs three things: money, labor, and publicity. With",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the first, we can secure the second and third. But can we get it,--and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
_get it in time to save?_,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
This volume is in every sense a contribution to a Cause; and as such it,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
ever will remain. I wish the public to receive it on that basis. So much,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

In order that the American people may correctly understand and judge the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"question of the extinction or preservation of our wild life, it is",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"necessary to recall the near past. It is not necessary, however, to go",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
far into the details of history; for a few quick glances at a few high,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
points will be quite sufficient for the purpose in view.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Any man who reads the books which best tell the story of the development,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"of the American colonies of 1712 into the American nation of 1912, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"takes due note of the wild-life features of the tale, will say without",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
hesitation that when the American people received this land from the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"bountiful hand of Nature, it was endowed with a magnificent and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
all-pervading supply of valuable wild creatures. The pioneers and the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"early settlers were too busy even to take due note of that fact, or to",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"comment upon it, save in very fragmentary ways.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Nevertheless, the wild-life abundance of early American days survived",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
down to so late a period that it touched the lives of millions of people,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
now living. Any man 55 years of age who when a boy had a taste for,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"""hunting,""--for at that time there were no ""sportsmen"" in America,--will",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
remember the flocks and herds of wild creatures that he saw and which,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
made upon his mind many indelible impressions.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"""Abundance"" is the word with which to describe the original animal life",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"that stocked our country, and all North America, only a short",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"half-century ago. Throughout every state, on every shore-line, in all",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the millions of fresh water lakes, ponds and rivers, on every mountain",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"range, in every forest, _and even on every desert_, the wild flocks and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
herds held sway. It was impossible to go beyond the settled haunts of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
civilized man and escape them.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
It was a full century after the complete settlement of New England and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the Virginia colonies that the wonderful big-game fauna of the great,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
plains and Rocky Mountains was really discovered; but the bison,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"millions, the antelope millions, the mule deer, the mountain sheep and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"mountain goat were there, all the time. In the early days, the millions",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
of pinnated grouse and quail of the central states attracted no serious,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
attention from the American people-at-large; but they lived and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"flourished just the same, far down in the seventies, when the greedy",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"market gunners systematically slaughtered them, and barreled them up for",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"""the market,"" while the foolish farmers calmly permitted them to do it.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
We obtain the best of our history of the former abundance of North,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"American wild life first from the pages of Audubon and Wilson; next,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"from the records left by such pioneers as Lewis and Clark, and last from",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the testimony of living men. To all this we can, many of us, add",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
observations of our own.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
To me the most striking fact that stands forth in the story of American,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
wild life one hundred years ago is the wide extent and thoroughness of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"its distribution. Wide as our country is, and marvelous as it is in the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"diversity of its climates, its soils, its topography, its flora, its",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"riches and its poverty, Nature gave to each square mile and to each acre",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"a generous quota of wild creatures, according to its ability to maintain",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"living things. No pioneer ever pushed so far, or into regions so",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"difficult or so remote, that he did not find awaiting him a host of",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
birds and beasts. Sometimes the pioneer was not a good hunter; usually,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"he was a stupid fisherman; but the ""game"" was there, nevertheless. The",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
time was when every farm had its quota.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The part that the wild life of America played in the settlement and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"development of this continent was so far-reaching in extent, and so",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"enormous in potential value, that it fairly staggers the imagination.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
From the landing of the Pilgrims down to the present hour the wild game,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
has been the mainstay and the resource against starvation of the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"pathfinder, the settler, the prospector, and at times even the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
railroad-builder. In view of what the bison millions did for the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Dakotas, Montana, Wyoming, Kansas and Texas, it is only right and square",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
that those states should now do something for the perpetual preservation,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
of the bison species and all other big game that needs help.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"For years and years, the antelope millions of the Montana and Wyoming",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"in Congress, and in Montana, with the Wool-Growers Association, which",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"Of the thousands of slaughtered robins, it would seem that no records",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
exist. It is to be understood that the annual slaughter of wild life in,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Louisiana never before reached such a pitch as now. Without drastic,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"measures, what will be the inevitable result? Does any man suppose that",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
even the wild millions of Louisiana can long withstand such slaughter as,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

improvements were made in the game laws of that state. The most,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"important feature was the suppression of wholesale market hunting, by",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
persons who are not residents of the state. A very limited amount of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"game may be sold and served as food in public places, but the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
restrictions placed upon this traffic are so effective that they will,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"vastly reduce the annual slaughter. In other respects, also, the cause",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
of wild life protection gained much; for which great credit is due to,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Mr. Edward A. McIlhenny.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

therefore be slaughtered without limit. That was the case last winter in,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

There are three kinds of extermination:,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
_The practical extermination of a species_ means the destruction of its,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
members to an extent so thorough and widespread that the species,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"disappears from view, and living specimens of it can not be found by",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
seeking for them. In North America this is to-day the status of the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"whooping crane, upland plover, and several other species. If any",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"individuals are living, they will be met with only by accident.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
_The absolute extermination_ of a species means that not one individual,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
of it remains alive. Judgment to this effect is based upon the lapse of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
time since the last living specimen was observed or killed. When five,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"years have passed without a living ""record"" of a wild specimen, it is",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
time to place a species in the class of the totally extinct.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
_Extermination in a wild state_ means that the only living,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
representatives are in captivity or otherwise under protection. This is,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the case of the heath hen and David's deer, of China. The American bison",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
is saved from being wholly extinct as a wild animal by the remnant of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

animals. There are probably millions of people who do not realize that,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

THE DESTRUCTION OF WILD LIFE BY DISEASES,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Every cause that has the effect of reducing the total of wild-life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
population is now a matter of importance to mankind. The violent and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
universal disturbance of the balance of Nature that already has taken,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
place throughout the temperate and frigid zone offers not only food for,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"thought, but it calls for vigorous action.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
There are vast sections in the populous centres of western civilization,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"where the destruction of species, even to the point of extermination, is",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
fairly inevitable. It is the way of Christian man to destroy all wild,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
life that comes within the sphere of influence of his iron heel. With,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the exception of the big game, this destruction is largely a",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"temperamental result, peculiar to the highest civilization. In India",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
where the same fields have been plowed for wheat and dahl and raggi for,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"at least 2,000 years, the Indian antelope, or ""black buck,"" the saras",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"crane and the adjutant stalk through the crops, and the nilgai and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
gazelle inhabit the eroded ravines in an agricultural land that averages,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"1,200 people to the square mile!",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"We have seen that even in farming country, where mud villages are as",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"thick as farm houses in Nebraska, wild animals and even hoofed game can",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
live and hold their own through hundreds of years of close association,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
with man. The explanation is that the Hindus regard wild animals as,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"creatures entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
they are not anxious to shoot every wild animal that shows its head. In,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the United States, nearly every game-inhabited community is animated by",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
a feeling that every wild animal must necessarily be killed as soon as,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
seen; and this sentiment often leads to disgraceful things. For,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"instance, in some parts of New England a deer straying into a town is at",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"once beset by the hue and cry, and it is chased and assaulted until it",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"is dead, by violent and disgraceful means. New York State, however,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"seems to have outgrown that spirit. During the past ten years, at least",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"a dozen deer in distress have been rescued from the Hudson River, or in",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"inland towns, or in barnyards in the suburbs of Yonkers and New York,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"and carefully cared for until ""the zoo people"" could be communicated",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"with. Last winter about 13 exhausted grebes and one loon were picked up,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
cared for and finally shipped with tender care to the Zoological Park.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"One distressed dovekie was picked up, but failed to survive.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The sentiment for the conservation of wild life has changed the mental,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
attitude of very many people. The old Chinese-Malay spirit which cries,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"""Kill! Kill!"" and at once runs amuck among suddenly discovered wild",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"animals, is slowly being replaced by a more humane and intelligent",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
sentiment. This is one of the hopeful and encouraging signs of the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
times.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The destruction of wild animals by natural causes is an interesting,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"subject, even though painful. We need to know how much destruction is",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"wrought by influences wholly beyond the control of man, and a few cases",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
must be cited.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

RINDERPEST IN AFRICA.--Probably the greatest slaughter ever wrought upon,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"wild animals by diseases during historic times, was by rinderpest, a",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
cattle plague which afflicted Africa in the last decade of the previous,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"century. Originally, the disease reached Africa by way of Egypt, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
came as an importation from Europe. From Egypt it steadily traveled,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"southward, reaching Somaliland in 1889. In 1896 it reached the Zambesi",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
River and entered Rhodesia. From thence it went on southward almost to,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the Cape. Not only did it sweep away ninety percent of the native cattle,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"but it also destroyed more than seventy-five per cent of the buffalos,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
antelopes and other hoofed game of Rhodesia. It was feared that many,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"species would be completely exterminated, but happily that fear was not",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
realized. The buffalo and antelope herds were fifteen years in breeding,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"up again to a reasonable number, but thanks to the respite from hunters",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"which they enjoyed for several years, finally they did recover.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Throughout British East Africa the supply of big game in 1905 was very,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

caribou having died of disease. The nature of that disease has remained,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"a mystery, because it seems that no pathologist ever has had an",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"opportunity to investigate it. Fortunately, however, the alleged disease",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
never has been sufficiently wide-spread or continuous to make,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

Fifteen years ago it prevailed in some portions of the west. In Colorado,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
it has several times been reported that many bighorn mountain sheep were,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"killed by ""scab,"" which was contracted on wild mountain pastures that",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
had been gone over by domestic sheep carrying that disease. From the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"reports current at that time, we inferred that about 200 mountain sheep",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
had been affected. It was feared that the disease would spread through,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the wild flocks and become general, but this did not occur. It seems",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
that the remnant flocks had become so isolated from one another that the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"with a very deadly chronic infective disease known as actinomycosis, or",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
In its early stage this disease is so subtle and slow that it is months,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"for two months. At the expiration of that period, no disease of any kind",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"of the dread disease. At once it was removed and isolated, but in about",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"10 days it died. The other two antelopes were promptly attacked, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
eventually died.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"The course of the disease is very intense, and thus far it has proven",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"incurable in our wild animals. We have lost about 10 antelopes from it,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"and one deer, usually, in each case, within ten days or two weeks from",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"In 1912, the future of the prong-horned antelope in real captivity seems",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
hopeless. We have decided not to bring any more specimens to our,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"institution, partly because all available candidates seem reasonably",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

unwilling to run further risks of having other hoofed animals inoculated,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
by them. Today we are anxiously wondering whether the jaw disease of the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
prong-horn is destined to exterminate the species. Such a catastrophe is,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
much to be feared. This is probably one of the reasons why the antelope,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"is steadily disappearing, despite protection.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
In 1906 we discovered the existence of actinomycosis among the black,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
mountain sheep of northern British Columbia. Two specimens out of six,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"were badly affected, the bones of the jaws being greatly enlarged, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
perforated by deep pits. The black sheep of the Stickine and Iskoot,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"extent to which actinomycosis prevails in those herds, or how deadly are",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

diseased skulls found by the writer in the taxidermic laboratory of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Frederick Sauter, in New York. The enormous swelling of the diseased jaw",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

could not have been reached in a few days after the disease became,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"apparent. Now, in our antelopes, the collapse and death of the victim",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
usually occurred in about 10 days from the time that the first swelling,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"was observed: which means a very virulent disease, and rapid progress at",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"The conclusion is that among the sheep, this disease does not carry off",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
its victims in any short period like 10 days. The animal must survive,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
for some months after it becomes apparent. At least two parties of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"American sportsmen have shot rams afflicted with this disease, but I",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
have no reports of any sheep having been found dead from this cause.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"This disease is well known among domestic cattle, but so far as we are",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
aware it never before has been found among wild animals. The black sheep,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
herds wherein it was found in British Columbia are absolutely isolated,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"from domestic cattle and all their influences, and therefore it seems",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
quite certain that the disease developed among the sheep,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"spontaneously,--a remarkable episode, to say the least. Whether it will",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"exterminate the black mountain sheep species, and in time spread to the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"white sheep of the northwest, is of course a matter of conjecture; but",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
there is nothing in the world to prevent a calamity of that kind. The,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
white sheep of Yukon Territory range southward until in the Sheslay,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Mountains they touch the sphere of influence of the black sheep, where",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the disease could easily be transmitted. It would be a good thing if,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
there existed between the two species a sheepless zone about 200 miles,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
wide.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
I greatly fear that actinomycosis is destined to play an important part,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
in the final extinction that seems to be the impending fate of the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
beautiful and valuable prong-horned antelope. In view of our hard,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"experiences, extending through ten years (1902-1912), I think this fear",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
is justified. All persons who live in country still inhabited by,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

  are busier than they were even in winter. The young rabbits are,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

  Not every white man in the South is a sportsman or even a shooter;,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  many are purely business men who have said let the ""nigger"" do as he",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  likes so long as he raises cotton and buys our goods. But Dixie has,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  her full share of true men of the out-of-doors and they have sworn,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  in downright Southern fashion that this thing has got to end.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  Nevertheless their problem is deep and puzzling. In Alabama they,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  made an effort and a beginning. They asked for a law requiring every,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  man to obtain written permission before entering the lands of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  another to hunt and shoot; they asked for a resident license law,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  taxing every gun not less than five dollars a year; for a shortened,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  season, a bag limit, and a complete system of State wardens.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  Unfortunately, a lot of white farmers were in the same range as the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  blacks, and being hit, too, they raised a great outcry. The result",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  was that the Alabama sportsmen got everything they asked for except,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  the foundation of the structure they were trying to build, the high",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  resident license or gun tax which alone could have shut out three,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  dollar guns and saved the remnant of the game. Under the new law the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  sale of game was forbidden, neither could it be shipped out of the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  State alive or dead; the ever popular non-resident license was,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  provided for; the season was shortened and the bag limited; the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  office of State game warden was created with deputies to be paid,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  from fines; hunting upon the lands of another without written,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  permission became a misdemeanor; and then the whole thing was,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  nullified by reducing the resident license to nothing where a man,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  shot upon his own land, one dollar in his own county, and two",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  dollars outside of it. In its practical workings the new law amounts,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  to this: A few northern gunners have paid the non-resident license,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  fee, and enough resident licenses have been taken out by the city",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  sportsmen to make up the handsome salary of the State warden. The,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  negro still hunts upon his own land _or upon the land of the man who,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  wants corn and cotton raised_, with perfect indifference to the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  whole thing. Who was to enforce the law against him? Not the one,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  disgusted deputy with three big counties to patrol who depended for,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  his salary upon the fines collected from the negroes. It would take,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  one man to every three miles square to protect the game in the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  South.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  The one effective way of dealing with the situation in Alabama was,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  to have legislated three dollar guns out of existence with a five,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  dollar tax, adding to this nearly a like amount on dogs. Hardly a",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  sportsman in the South will disagree with this conclusion. But,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  sportsmen never had a majority vote either in the South or in the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  North, and the South's grave problem is yet unsolved.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

Mr. Askins has fairly stated a profoundly disturbing case. The remedy,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
must contain at least three ingredients. The sportsmen of the South must,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"matter of comity between states, the gentlemen of the South must pass",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
laws to stop the killing of northern song-birds and all crop-protecting,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

slaughter for the feather trade; that Florida still contains a supply of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

This chapter is a curtain-dropper to the preceding chapter. As a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"clearly-cut, concrete case, the reader will find it unique and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
1.--There are at present _too many_ breeding cows in the Yellowstone,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

2.--There are far too few good breeding bulls.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"_Conclusion_:--For five years, entirely prohibit the killing of adult",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"male elk, and kill only females, and young males. This would gradually",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"diminish the number of calves born each year, by about 2,500, and by the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"end of five years it would reduce the number, _and the annual birth_, of",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
females to a figure sufficiently limited that the herds could be,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
maintained on existing ranges.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

Thanks to the diligence with which sportsmen and field naturalists have,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"and grazing will become populated by rifle-bearing men, with the usual",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"result to the wild mammals and birds. At the same time, the game of the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"On the other hand, the unconquerable forest jungles of certain portions",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
On the open mountains of the world and on the grazing lands most big,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"attacks of five times too many hunters, open seasons that are too long,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"and bag limits that are far too liberal. As an example, consider Africa",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Viewed in any way it may be taken, the bag limit in British East Africa",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"years, at last the big game of India has made a good start on the road",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
to vanishment. Up to 1870 it had held its own with a tenacity that was,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"astonishing. In 1877, I found the Ganges--Jumna dooab, the Animallai",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Hills, the Wynaad Forest and Ceylon literally teeming with herds of",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
game. The Animallais in particular were a hunter's paradise. In each day,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"of hunting, large game of some kind was a certainty. The Nilgiri Hills",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"had been quite well shot out, but in view of the very small area and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
I think that no such great wild-life sights as those of the plateau,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
regions of Africa ever were seen in southern Asia. Conditions there are,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Even to-day we find that the primitive conditions of 1877 have been,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"greatly changed. In the first place, about every native shikaree",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"(hunter) owns a rifle, at a cost of about $25; and many other natives",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"possess guns, and assume to hunt with them. The logical conclusion of",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
this is more hunting and less game. The development of the country has,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
reduced the cover for game. New roads and railways have made the game,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"districts easily accessible, and real sportsmen are now three or four",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
times as numerous as they were in 1877.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

how much big game remains on the Delectable Mountains in comparison with,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

Before we leave the subject of Chinamen let us consider another recent,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
factor in the destruction of wild life which is at present widely,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"operative in China itself. This is the cold storage warehouse, of which",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
six or eight enormous ones have gone up in different parts of the East.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"To speak in detail only of the one at Hankow, six hundred miles up the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Yangtze, we found it to be the largest structure in the city. Surrounded",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"by a high wall, with each entrance and exit guarded by armed Sikhs, it",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
seemed like the feudal castle of some medieval baron. Why such secrecy,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"is necessary I could not learn, as there are no laws against its",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
business. But so carefully guarded is its premises that until a short,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
time ago even the British consul-general of Hankow had not been allowed,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"to enter. He, however, at last refused to sign the papers for any more",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
outgoing shipments until he should be allowed to see what was going on,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
within the warehouse. I hoped to be able to look over some of the frozen,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"pheasants for interesting scientific material, but of course was not",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
allowed to do so.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Although here in the heart of China, outside changes are not felt so",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
strongly and the newly-acquired meat diet of the border and emigrant,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Chinese is hardly apparent, these warehouses have opened up a new source",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"of revenue, which has met with instant response. Thousands and tens of",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
thousands of wild shot or trapped pheasants and other birds are now,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
brought to these establishments by the natives from far and near. The,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"birds are frozen, and twice a year shipped on specially refrigerated P.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
and O. steamships to England and the continent of Europe where they seem,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
to find a ready sale. Pigs and chickens also figure in the shipments.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Now the pheasants have for centuries existed in enormous numbers in the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"endless ricefields of China, without doing any damage to the crops. In",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
fact they could not be present in such numbers without being an,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
important factor in keeping down insect and other enemies of the grain.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"When their numbers are decimated as they are being at present, there",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
must eventually result a serious upsetting of the balance of nature. Let,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"us hope that in some way this may be avoided, and that the present",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
famine deaths of thirty thousand or more in some provinces will not be,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
increased many fold.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
When I started on this search for pheasants I was repeatedly told by old,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
explorers in the east that my task would be very different from theirs,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"of thirty years ago; that I would find steamers, railroads and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
automobiles where formerly were only canoes and jungle. I indeed found,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"this as reported, but while my task was different it was made no easier.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Formerly, to be sure, one had from the start to paddle slowly or push",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
along the trails made by natives or game animals. But then the wild life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"was encountered at once, while I found it always far from the end of the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"steamer's route or the railroad's terminal, and still to be reached only",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
by the most primitive modes of travel.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
I cite this to give point to my next great cause of destruction; the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
burning and clearing of vast stretches of country for the planting of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"rubber trees. The East seems rubber mad, and whether the enormous output",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
which will result from the millions of trees set out month after month,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"will be profitable, I cannot say. I can think only of the vanishing of",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the _entire fauna_ and _flora_ of many districts which I have seen as a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
direct result of this commercial activity. One leaves Port Swettenham on,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the west coast of Selangor, and for the hour's run to Kuala Lumpur sees",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"hardly anything but vast radiating lines of spindling rubber trees, all",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"underbrush cleared, all native growths vanished. From Kuala Lumpur to",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Kuala Kubu at the very foot of the mountain backbone of the Malay,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"cultivation, the climbing fern and a coarse, useless ""lalang"" grass",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
covers every inch of ground. One can hardly imagine a more complete,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
blotting out of the native fauna and flora of any one limited region.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
And ever-extending roads for the increasing motor cars are widening the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"cleared zone, mile after mile to the north and south.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"In this region, as we pushed on over the mountains into the wilderness",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"of Pahang, we saw little of the actual destruction of the primeval",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"native growth, but elsewhere it became a common sight. Once, for many",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
days we studied the wonderful life of a jungle which stretched up to our,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
very camp. Troops of rollicking wa-was or gibbons frequented the forest;,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"squirrels, tupaias, birds and insects in myriads were everywhere during",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the day. Great fruit-bats, flying lemurs, owls and other nocturnal",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
creatures made the evenings and nights full of interest.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"And then, one day without warning came the sound of an ax, and another",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"and another. From that moment the songs, cries, chirps and roars of the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
jungle were seldom heard from our camp. Every day saw new phalanxes of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"splendid primeval trees fallen, or half suspended in their rigging of",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"lianas. The leaves withered, the flower petals fell and we heard no more",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the crackling of bamboos in the wind. Then the pitiful survivors of the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"destruction were brought to us; now a baby flying lemur, flung from its",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"hole by the falling of some tree; young tupaias, nestling birds; a few",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
out of the thousands of creatures from insects to mammals which were,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"slain so that a Chinaman or Malay might eke a few dollars, four or five",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"years hence, from a grove of rubber trees. I do not say it is wrong. Man",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"terrible, a hopeless thing.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
One cannot at present leave the tourist line of travel in the East,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
without at once encountering evidence of the wholesale direct slaughter,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
THE SAVAGE VIEW-POINT OF THE GUNNER,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The mental attitude of the men who shoot constitutes a deadly factor in,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the destruction of wild life and the extermination of species. Fully,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"ninety-five per cent of the sportsmen, gunners and other men and boys",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"who kill game, all over the world and in all nations, regard game birds",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"and mammals only as things to be killed _and eaten_, and not as",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
creatures worth preserving for their beauty or their interest to,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"mankind. This is precisely the viewpoint of the cave-man and the savage,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
and it has come down from the Man-with-a-Club to the Man-with-a-Gun,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
absolutely unchanged save for one thing: the latter sometimes is,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
prompted to save to-day in order to slaughter to-morrow.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The above statement of an existing fact may seem harsh; and some persons,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
may be startled by it; but it is based on an acquaintance with thousands,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"of men who shoot all kinds of game, all over the world. My critics",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
surely will admit that my opportunities to meet the sportsmen and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"gunners of the world are, and for thirty-five years have been, rather",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"favorable. As a matter of fact, I think the efforts of the hunters of my",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
personal acquaintance have covered about seven-tenths of the hunting,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
grounds of the world. If the estimate that I have formed of the average,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"hunter's viewpoint is wrong, or even partially so, I will be glad to",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
have it proven in order that I may reform my judgment and apologize.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
In working with large bodies of bird-shooting sportsmen I have,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
steadily--and also painfully--been impressed by their intentness on.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"killing, and by the fact that _they seek to preserve game only to kill",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
it!_ Who ever saw a bird-shooter rise in a convention and advocate the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
preservation of any species of game bird on account of its beauty or its,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
esthetic interest _alive?_ I never did; and I have sat in many,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"conventions of sportsmen. All the talk is of open seasons, bag limits",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
and killing rights. The man who has the hardihood to stand up and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"propose a five-year close season has ""a hard row to hoe."" Men rise and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"say: ""It's all nonsense! There's plenty of quail shooting on Long Island",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"yet.""",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Throughout the length and breadth of America, the ruling passion is to",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
kill as long as anything killable remains. The man who will openly,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
advocate the stopping of quail-shooting because the quails are of such,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"great value to the farmers, or because they are so _beautiful_ and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"companionable to man, receives no sympathy from ninety per cent of the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
bird-killing sportsmen. The remaining ten per cent think seriously about,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the matter, and favor long close seasons. It is my impression that of",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the men who shoot, it is only among the big-game hunters that we find",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"much genuine admiration for game animals, or any feeling remotely",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
resembling regard for it.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The moment that a majority of American gunners concede the fact that,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"game birds are worth preserving for their beauty, and their value as",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"living neighbors to man, from that moment there is hope for the saving",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"of the Remnant. That will indeed be the beginning of a new era, of a",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"millennium in fact, in the preservation of wild life. It will then be",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
easy to enact laws for ten-year close seasons on whole groups of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
species. Think what it would mean for such a close season to be enacted,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"for all the grouse of the United States, all the shore-birds of the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"United States, or the wild turkey wherever found!",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"To-day, the great--indeed, the _only_--opponents of long close seasons",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
on game birds are the gunners. Whenever and wherever you introduce a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"bill to provide such a season, you will find that this is true. The gun",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
clubs and the Downtrodden Hunters' and Anglers' Protective Associations,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"will be quick to go after their representatives, and oppose the bill.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
And state senators and assemblymen will think very hard and with strong,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
courage before they deliberately resolve to do their duty regardless of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the opposition of ""a large body of sportsmen,""--men who have votes, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
who know how to take revenge on lawmakers who deprive them of their,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"""right"" to kill. The greatest speech ever made in the Mexican Congress",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"was uttered by the member who solemnly said: ""I rise to sacrifice",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"ambition to honor!""",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"Really, it is to me very strange that gunners never care to save game",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
birds on account of their beauty. One living bob white on a fence is,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
better than a score in a bloody game-bag. A live squirrel in a tree is,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
poetry in motion; but on the table a squirrel is a rodent that tastes as,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
a rat smells. Beside the ocean a flock of sandpipers is needed to,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
complete the beautiful picture; but on the table a sandpiper is beneath,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"contempt. A live deer trotting over a green meadow, waving a triangular",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

THE COTTON BOLL WEEVIL.--Let us take one other concrete case. The cotton,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
boll weevil invaded the United States from Mexico in 1894. Ten years,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
later it was costing the cotton planters an annual loss estimated at,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
fifteen million dollars per year. Later on that loss was estimated at,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
twenty million dollars. The cotton boll weevil strikes at the heart of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the industry by destroying the boll of the cotton plant. While the total,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"loss never can be definitely ascertained, we know that it has amounted",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
to many millions of dollars. The figure given above has been widely,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

HOW TO PASS A NEW LAW,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
We venture to say that the average citizen little realizes how possible,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
it is to secure the passage of a law that is clearly necessary for the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"better protection of wild life and forests. Because of this, and of the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"necessity for exact knowledge, I shall here set down specific",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
instructions on this subject.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
THE PERSONAL EQUATION.--One determined man can secure the passage of a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"good law, provided he is reasonably intelligent and sufficiently",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
determined. The man who starts a movement must make up his mind to,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"follow it up, direct its fortunes, stay with it when the storms of",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"opposition beat upon it, and never give up until it is signed by the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"governor. He must be willing to sacrifice his personal convenience, many",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"of his pleasures, and work when his friends are asleep or pleasuring.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
In working for the protection of wild life there is one mighty and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
unfailing source of consolation. It is this:,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"_Your cause always gains in strength, and the cause of the destroyers",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
always loses strength!_,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
THE CHOICE OF A CAUSE.--Be broad-minded. Do not rush to the legislature,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
with a demand for a law to permit the taking of bull-heads with,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"June-bugs in the creeks of your township, or to give your county a",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
specially early open season on quail in order that your boy may try his,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"new gun before he goes back to college. _Don't propose any ""local""",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"legislation_; for in progressive states, local game legislation is",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"coming strongly into disfavor,--just as it should! Legislate for your",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"whole state, and nothing less.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Do not bother your legislature with a trivial bill. Choose a cause that,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"is worth while to grown men, and it shall be well with you. It takes no",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
more time to pass a large bill than a small one; and big men prefer to,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
be identified with big measures.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Before you have a bill drawn, advise with men whose opinions are worth",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"having. If the end you have in mind is a great and good one, _go ahead_,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
whether you secure support in advance or not. If the needs of the hour,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"clearly demand the measure, _go ahead_, even though you start absolutely",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
alone. A good measure never goes far without attracting company.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"DRAFTING A BILL.--As a rule, the members of a legislative body do not",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
have time to draft bills on subjects that are new or strange to them. A,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
short bill is easily prepared by your own representative; but a lengthy,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"bill, covering a serious reform, is a different matter. Hire a lawyer to",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
draft the bill for you. A really good lawyer will not charge much for,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"drafting a bill that is to benefit the public, and grind no private axe;",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"but if the bill is long, and requires long study, even the good citizen",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
must charge something.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Your bill must fully recognize existing laws. It must be either,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
prohibitory or permissive; which means that it can say what shall not be,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"done, or else that which may be done according to law, all other acts",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
being forbidden. Your lawyer must decide which form is best. For my,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"part, I greatly prefer the prohibitive form, as being the stronger and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
more impressive of the two. I think it is the province of the law _to,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"forbid_ the destruction of wild life and forests, under penalties.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
PENALTIES.--Every law should provide a penalty for its infringement; but,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the penalty should not be out of all proportion to the offense. It is,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
just as unwise to impose a fine of one dollar for killing song-birds for,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
food as it is to provide for a fine of three hundred dollars. A fine,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"that is too small fails to impress the prisoner, and it begets contempt",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
for the law and the courts! A fine that is altogether too high is apt to,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"be set aside by the court as ""excessive."" In my opinion, the best fines",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
for wild life slaughter would be as follows:,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Shooting, netting or trapping song-birds, and other non-game",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  birds, each bird                                          $5 to $25",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Killing game birds out of season, each bird                 10 to  50",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Selling game contrary to law, each offense                 100 to 200",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Dynamiting fish                                            100 to 200,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Seining or netting game fishes                              50 to 200,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Shooting birds with unfair weapons                          10 to 100,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Killing an egret, Carolina parakeet or whooping crane      100 to 200",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Killing a mountain sheep or antelope anywhere in the U.S.         500,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Killing an elk contrary to law                                     50,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Killing a female deer, or fawn without horns, each offense         50",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Trapping a grizzly bear for its skin                              100,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"For killing a man ""by mistake,"" the fine should be $500, payable in five",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"annual instalments, to the court, for the family of the victim.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Whenever fines are not paid, the convicted party should be sentenced to",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
imprisonment at hard labor at the rate of one-half day for each dollar,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
of the fine imposed; and a sentence at hard labor should be the _first,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
option of the court_! Many a rich and reckless poacher snaps his fingers,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
at fines; but a sentence to hard labor would strike terror to the heart,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"of the most brazen of them. To all such men, ""labor"" is the twin terror",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"to ""death.""",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
THE INTRODUCTION OF A BILL.--Much wisdom is called for in the selection,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
of legislative champions for wild-life bills. It is possible to state,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
here only the leading principles involved.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Of course it is best to look for an introducer within the political,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
party that is in the majority. A man who has many important bills on his,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
hands is bound to give his best attention to his own pet measures; and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
it is best to choose a man who is not already overloaded. If a man has a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"host of enemies, pass him by. By all means choose a man whose high",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
character and good name will be a tower of strength to your cause; and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"if necessary, _wait for him to make up his mind_. Mr. Lawrence W.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Trowbridge waited three long and anxious weeks in the hope that Hon.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
George A. Blauvelt would finally consent to champion the Bayne bill in,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the New York Assembly. At last Mr. Blauvelt consented to take it up; and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the time spent in waiting for his decision was a grand investment! He,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
was the Man of all men to pilot that bill through the Assembly.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Very often the ""quiet man"" of a legislative body is a good man to",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
champion a new and drastic measure. The quiet man who makes up his mind,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"to take hold of ""a hard bill to pass"" often astonishes the natives by",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"his ability to get results. Representative John F. Lacey, of Iowa, made",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"his name a household word all over the United States by the quiet,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"steady, tireless and finally resistless energy with which for three long",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"years in Congress he worked for ""the Lacey bird bill."" For years his",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"colleagues laughed at him, and cheerfully voted down his bill. But he",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
persisted. His cause steadily gained in strength; and his final triumph,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"laid the axe at the root of a thousand crimes against wild life,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
throughout the length and breadth of this land. He rendered the people,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
of America a service that entitles him to our everlasting gratitude and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
remembrance.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF A BILL.--As soon as a bill is introduced it is,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"referred to a committee, to be examined and reported upon. If there is",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"opposition,--and to every bill that really does something worth while",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"there always is opposition,--then there is a ""hearing."" The committee",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"appoints a day, when the friends and foes of the bill assemble, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
express their views.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The week preceding a hearing is your busy week. You must plan your,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"campaign, down to the smallest details. Pick the men whom you wish to",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"have speak (for ten minutes each) on the various parts of your bill, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
divide the topics and the time between them. Call upon the friends of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the bill in various portions of the state to attend and ""say something.""",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Go up with a strong body of fine men. _Have as many organizations,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"represented as you possibly can_! The ""organizations"" represent the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"great mass of people, and the voters also.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"When you reach the hearing, hand to your bill's champion, who will be",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"floor manager for your side, a clear and concise list of your speakers,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"carefully arranged and stating who's who. That being done, you have only",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
to fill your own ten minutes and afterward enjoy the occasion.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"THE VALUE OF ACCURACY.--It is unnecessary to say, in working for a",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"bill,--_always be sure of your facts_. Never let your opponents catch",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"you tripping in accuracy of statement. If you make one serious error,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
your enemies will turn it against you to the utmost. Better understate,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
facts than overstate them. This shrewd old world quickly recognizes the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"careful, conservative man whose testimony is so true and so rock-founded",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
that no assaults can shake it. Legislators are quick to rely on the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
words and opinions of the man who can safely be trusted. If your enemies,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"try to overwhelm you with extravagant statements, that are unfair to",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"your cause, the chances are that the men who judge between you will",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"recognize them by their ear-marks, and discount them accordingly.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
WORK WITH MEMBERS.--Sometimes a subject that is put before a legislative,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"body is so new, and the thing proposed is so drastic, it becomes",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
necessary to take measures to place a great many facts before each,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
member of the body. Under such circumstances the member naturally,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"desires to be ""shown."" The cleanest and finest campaigning for a reform",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"measure is that in which both sides deal with facts, rather than with",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"personal importunities. With a good cause in hand, it is a pleasure to",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
prepare concise statements of facts and conditions from which a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
legislator may draw logical conclusions. Whenever a bill can be won,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"through in that way, game protection work becomes a delight.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
In all important new measures affecting the rights and the property of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the whole people of a state, the conscientious legislator wishes to know",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"how the people feel about it. When you tell him that ""The wild life",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
belongs to the whole people of the state; and this bill is in their,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"interest,"" he needs to know for certain that your proposition is true.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Sometimes there is only one way in which he can be fully convinced; and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
that is by the people of his district.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Then it becomes necessary to send out a general alarm, and call upon the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
People to write to their representatives and express _their_ views. Give,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"them, in printed matter, the _latest facts_ in the case, forecast the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"future as you think it should be forecast, then demand that the men and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"women who are interested do write to their senators and assemblyman, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"express _their_ views, in _their own way!_ Let there be no ""machine",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"letters"" sent out, all ready for signature; for such letters are a waste",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"of effort, and belong in the waste baskets to which they are quickly",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"consigned. The members of legislative bodies hate them, and rightly,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"too. They want to hear from men who can think for themselves, give",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"reasons of their own, and express their desires in their own way.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
THE PRESS AND THE NEWSPAPERS.--It is impossible to overestimate the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"influence of the newspapers and the periodical press in general, in the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"protection of wild life. But for their sympathy, their support and their",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"independent assaults upon the Army of Destruction, our game species",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"would nearly all of them have been annihilated, long ago. Editors are",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"sympathetic and responsive good-citizens, as keenly sensitive regarding",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"their duties as any of the rest of us are, and from the earliest times",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"of protection they have been on the firing line, helping to beat back",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the destroyers. It is indeed a rare sight to see an editor giving aid,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
comfort or advice to the enemy. I can not recall more than a score of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
articles that I have seen or heard of during thirty years in this field,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"that opposed the cause of wild life protection.[K] At this moment, for",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

one bill that was saved from defeat only because its promoter dragged,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

SIGNING THE BILL.--The promoter of a great measure always seeks the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
sympathy of the Chief Executive early in the day; but he should not make,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the diplomatic error of trying to exact promises or pledges in advance.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"signing that he ""cannot approve it,"" it is no reason to give up in",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
despair. Many an executive approval has been snatched at the last,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"moment, as a brand from the burning. _Ask for a hearing before the bill",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"bill, _he will sign it_, even though personally he is opposed to it! The",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

NEW LAWS NEEDED: A ROLL-CALL OF THE STATES,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The principles of wild-life protection and encouragement are now so,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
firmly established as to leave little room for argument regarding their,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"value. When they are set forth before the people of any given state, the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
only question is of willingness to do the right thing; of duty or a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
defiance of duty; of good citizenship or the reign of selfishness. Men,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
who do not wish to do their duty purposely befog great issues by noisy,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
talk and tiresome academic discussions of trivial details; and such men,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
are the curse and scourge of reform movements.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"There are a very few persons who foolishly assert that ""there are too",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"many game laws!"" It is entirely wrong for any person to make such a",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"statement, for it tends to promote harmful error. The fact that our laws",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"are _too lenient_, or are not fully enforced, is no excuse for",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"denouncing their purposes. We have all along been too timid, too self",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"indulgent, and too much afraid of hurting the feelings of the game-hogs.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Give me the power to make the game laws of any state or province and I,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
will guarantee to save the _non-migratory_ wild life of that region. I,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"will not only make adequate laws, but I will also provide means, men and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"penalties by which _they will be enforced_! It is easy and simple, for",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
men who are not afraid.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
I have been at considerable pains to analyze the game laws of each,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"state, ascertain their shortcomings, and give a list of the faults that",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
need correction by new legislation. It has required no profound wisdom,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"to do this, because the principles involved are so plain that any",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
intelligent schoolboy fifteen years old can master them in one hour. I,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"have performed this task hopefully, in the belief that in many states",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the real issues have not been plainly put before the people. Hereafter,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
no state shall destroy its wild life through ignorance of the laws that,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
would preserve it.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Let no man say that ""it is too late to save the wild life""; for",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"excepting the dead-and-gone species, that is not true. Let no man say",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"that ""we can not save the wild life by law""; for that is not true,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"either. As long as laws are lax, even law-abiding people will take",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
advantage of them.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
There are millions of men who think it is _right to kill all the game,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
that the law allows_! There are thousands of women who think it is right,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"to wear aigrettes as long as the law permits their sale! And yet, if we",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
are resolute and diligent there is plenty of hope for the future. During,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the past three years, to go no farther back, we have seen the whole",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
state of New York swept clean of the traffic in native wild game by the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Bayne law, and of the traffic in wild birds' plumage on women's hats",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"through the Dutcher law. To-day, in this state, we find ninety-nine",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"women out of every one hundred wearing flowers, and laces, and plush and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"satin on their hats, instead of the heads, bodies and feathers of wild",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
birds that were the regular thing until three years ago. The change has,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
been a powerful commentary on the value of good laws for the protection,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
of wild life. The Dutcher law has caused the plumage of wild birds,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
_almost wholly to disappear from the State of New York_!,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
We shall here point out the plain duty of each state; and then it will,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"be up to them, individually, to decide whether they can stand the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
blood-test or not.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"A state or a nation can be ungentlemanly, unfair or mean, just the same",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

slaughter of migratory game or song birds that belong in part to sister,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"states. _Every state holds its migratory bird life in trust, for the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
benefit of the people of the nation at large_. A state is just as,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

time to open books of account.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

THE UNITED STATES AT LARGE.--There are two great measures that should be,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
carried into effect by the governing body of the United States. One is,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the enactment of a law providing federal protection for all migratory,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
birds; and Canada and Mexico should be induced to join with the United,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
States _in an international treaty to that effect_.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The other necessary measure is the passage of a joint resolution of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Congress _declaring every national forest and forest reserve also a game,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"preserve and general sanctuary for wild life_, in which there shall be",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
no hunting or killing of wild creatures of any kind save predatory,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
animals.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"The tendency of the times,--and the universal slaughter of wild life on",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"this continent,--point straight as an arrow flies in that direction.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Soon or late, we have GOT to come to it! If Congress does not take the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"initiatory steps, _the People will_! Such a consummation is necessary;",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
it is justified by common sense and the inexorable logic of the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"situation, and when done it will be right.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The time was when the friends of wild life did not dare speak of this,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
subject in Washington save in whispers. That was in the days when the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Appalachian Park bill could not be passed, and when there were angry",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
mutterings and even curses leveled against Gifford Pinchot and the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Forestry Bureau because so many national forests were being set aside.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
That was in the days when a few western sheep-men thought that they,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"owned the whole Rocky Mountains without having bought them. To-day, the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
American people have grown accustomed to the idea of having the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
resources of the public domain saved and conserved for the benefit of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the millions rather than lavished upon a favored few. To-day it is,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
perfectly safe to talk about making every national forest a first class,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"wild-life sanctuary, and it is up to the People to request Congress to",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"take that action, at once.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"The Weeks bill, the Anthony bill, and the McLean bill now before",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Congress to provide federal protection for migratory birds are,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
practically identical. All three are good bills; and it matters not,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
which one finally becomes a law. Whichever is put forward finally for,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
passage should provide federal protection for _all_ migratory birds that,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"ever enter the United States, Alaska, or Porto Rico. Why favor the duck",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"and leave the robin to its fate, or vice versa? It will be just as easy",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"to do this task by wholes as by halves. The time to hesitate, to feel",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"timid, or to be afraid of the other fellow has gone by. To-day the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
millions of honest and serious-minded Americans are ready to back the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"most thorough and most drastic policy, because that has become the most",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"necessary and the best policy. Furthermore, it is the only policy worthy",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
of serious consideration.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"very remiss. Here is where we intend to hew to the line, and without",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
fear or favor set forth the standing of each state according to its,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
merits or its lack of merits. In a life-or-death matter such as now,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

It is a satisfaction to be able to open this list with the name of a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

the pioneer state of the South. New York now occupies a similar position,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"stop it unaided by the federal government, and those birds are",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
recognized and treated as the farmers' best friends. The absurd system,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"of game has been stopped, and since that stoppage, quail have increased.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"The trapping and export of game have ceased, and wild turkeys and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

The story of game protection in Alabama began in 1907. Prior to that,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"time, the slaughter of wild life was very great. It is known that",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"enormous numbers of quail were annually killed by negro farm hands, who",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"hunted at least three days each week, regardless of work to be done. The",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"slaughter of quail, wild ducks, woodcock, doves, robins and snipe was",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"described as ""nauseating.""",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The change that has been wrought since 1907 is chiefly due to the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
efforts of one man. Alabama owes her standing to-day to the admirable,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"qualities of John H. Wallace, Jr., her Game and Fish Commissioner,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
There are reasons for the belief that Maine is conserving her large game,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
better than any other state or province in North America. One glance,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
over her laws is sufficient to convince anyone that instead of studying,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the clamor of her shooting population, Maine has actually been studying",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the needs of her game, and providing for those needs. If all other",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"states were doing equally well, the task of writing a book of admonition",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
would have been unnecessary. The proof of Maine's alertness is to be,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"found in the number of her extra short, or entirely closed, seasons on",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
game. For example:,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

People who have not learned the facts habitually think of Maine as a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
vast killing-ground for deer; and it is well for it to be known that the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

abundance or scarcity of game.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Maine has wisely chosen to regard her hunting-grounds and her deer as a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"valuable asset, and she manages them accordingly. To be a guide in that",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"state is to be a good citizen, and a protector of game from illegal",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
slaughter. No non-resident may hunt without a licensed guide. The,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"licenses for the thousands of deer killed in Maine each year, and the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"expenses of the visiting sportsmen who hunt them, annually bring into",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the state and leave there a huge sum of money, variously estimated at",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"from $2,000,000 to $3,000,000. One can only guess at the amount from the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
number of non-resident licenses issued; but certainly the total can not,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The laws of Utah are far from being up to the requirements of the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
present hour. One strange thing has happened in Utah.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"When I spent a week in Salt Lake City in 1888, and devoted some time to",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"inquiring into game conditions, the laws of the state were very bad. At",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the mouth of Bear River, ducks were being slaughtered for the markets by",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the tens of thousands. The cold-blooded, wide open and utterly shameless",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"way in which it was being done, right at the doors of Salt Lake City,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
was appalling.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"At the same time, the law permitted the slaughter of _spotted fawns_. I",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"slaughtered innocents, _260 in number_, that a rascal had collected and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
was offering at fifty cents each. In reply to a question as to their,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"use, he said: ""I tink de sportsmen like 'em for to make vests oud of.""",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
And then came Nature's punishment upon Utah for that duck slaughter. The,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

out. It seems to be due to the fact that countless thousands of ducks,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
have been feeding on the exposed alluvial flats at the mouth of the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
creek that drains off the _sewage of Salt Lake City_. The conditions are,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

THE FEDERAL PROTECTION OF MIGRATORY BIRDS.--The bill now before Congress,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
for the protection of all migratory birds by the national government is,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the most important measure ever placed before that body in behalf of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
wild life. A stranger to this proposition will need to pause for thought,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"in order to grasp its full meaning, and appreciate the magnitude of its",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
influence.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The urgent necessity for a law of this nature is due to the utter,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
inadequacy of the laws that prevail throughout some portions of the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
United States concerning the slaughter and preservation of birds. Any,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
law that is not enforced is a poor law. There is not one state in the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Union, nor a single province in Canada, in which the game birds, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"other birds criminally shot as game, are not being killed far faster",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"than they are breeding, and thereby being exterminated.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Several states are financially unable to employ a force of salaried game,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"wardens; and wherever that is true, the door to universal slaughter is",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
wide open. Let him who questions this take Virginia as a case in point.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
A loyal Virginian told me only this year that in his state the warden,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"system is an ineffective farce, and the game is not protected, because",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the wardens can not afford to patrol the state for nothing.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"This condition prevails in a number of states, north and south,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
especially south. It is my belief that throughout nine-tenths of the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"South, the negroes and poor whites are slaughtering birds exactly as",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
they please. It is the _permanent residents_ of the haunts of birds and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
game that are exterminating the wild life.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"The value of the birds as destroyers of noxious insects, has been set",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
forth in Chapter XXIII. Their total value is enormous--or it _would_ be,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
if the birds were alive and here in their normal numbers. To-day there,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
are about one-tenth as many birds as were alive and working thirty years,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
ago. During the past thirty years the destruction of our game birds has,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"been enormous, and the insectivorous birds have greatly decreased.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"The damages annually inflicted upon the farm, orchard and garden crops",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
of this country are very great. When a city is destroyed by earthquake,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"or fire, and $100,000,000 worth of property is swept away, we are racked",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
with horror and pity; and the cities of America pour out money like,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
water to relieve the resultant distress. We are shocked because we can,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"_see_ the flames, the smoke and the ruins.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"And yet, we annually endure with perfect equanimity (_because we can not",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"by insects. The damage is inflicted silently, insidiously, without any",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"scare heads or wooden type in the newspapers, and so we pay the price",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"but of all the persons to whom the needs of that bill are presented, how",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
many will take the time to promote its quick passage by direct appeals,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"The good that would be accomplished, annually, by the enactment of a law",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

but it is my belief that within a very few years the increase in bird,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

bird millions would protect them--if they were here as they were in,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

throw the strong arm of federal protection around 610 species of birds.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

power of the state is ignored.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The list of migratory birds includes most of the perching birds; all the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
shore birds (_great_ destroyers of bad insects); all the swifts and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
swallows; the goat-suckers (whippoorwill and nighthawk); some of the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
woodpeckers; most of the rails; pigeons and doves; many of the hawks;,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"some of the cranes and herons and all the geese, ducks and swans.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
A movement for the federal protection of migratory game birds was,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"proposed to Congress by George Shiras, 3rd, who as a member of the House",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
in the 58th Congress introduced a bill to secure that end. An excellent,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
brief on that subject by Mr. Shiras appeared in the printed hearing on,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"introduced in the 59th, 60th and 61st sessions, mention need be made",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
only of the measures under consideration in the present Congress. One of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

REASONS WHY THE SALE OF WILD GAME SHOULD CEASE EVERYWHERE,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  1.--Because fully 95 per cent of our legitimate stock of feathered,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  game has already been destroyed.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  2.--Because if market-gunning and the sale of game continue ten,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  years longer, all our feathered game will be swept away.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  3.--Because when the sale of game was permitted one dealer was able,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  to sell 1,000,000 _game birds per year in New York City_, so he",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  himself said.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  4.--Because it is a fixed fact that every wild species of mammal,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  bird or reptile that is pursued for money-making purposes eventually,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  is wiped out of existence. Even the whales of the sea are no,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  exception.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  5.--Because at least 50 per cent of the decrease in our feathered,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  game is due to market-gunning, and the sale of game. Look at the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

  New England.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  6.--Because the laws that permit the commercial slaughter of wild,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  birds for the benefit of less than five per cent of the inhabitants,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  of any state are directly against the interest of the 95 per cent of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  other people, to _whom that game partly belongs_.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  7.--Because game killed ""for sale"" is not intended to satisfy",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  ""hunger."" The people who eat game in large cities do not know what",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  hunger is, save by hearsay. Purchased game is used chiefly in",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  over-feeding; and as a rule it does far more harm than good.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  8.--Because the greatest value to be derived from any game bird is,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  in seeing it, and photographing it, and enjoying its living company",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  in its native haunts. Who will love the forests when they become,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  destitute of wild life, and desolate?",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"  birds to us, in a few years_.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  10.--Because the pace that New York and Massachusetts have set in,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  this matter will render it easier to procure the passage of Bayne,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  laws in other states.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

BRINGING BACK THE VANISHED BIRDS AND GAME,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The most charming trait of wild-life character is the alacrity and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
confidence with which wild birds and mammals respond to the friendly,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
advances of human friends. Those who are not very familiar with the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
mental traits of our wild neighbors may at first find it difficult to,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
comprehend the marvelous celerity with which both birds and mammals,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"recognize friendly overtures from man, and respond to them.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"At the present juncture, this state of the wild-animal mind becomes a",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
factor of great importance in determining what we can do to prevent the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"extermination of species, and to promote the increase and return of wild",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
life.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
I think that there is not a single wild mammal or bird species now,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"living that can not, or does not, quickly recognize protection, _and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
take advantage of it_. The most conspicuous of all familiar examples are,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the wild animals of the Yellowstone Park. They embrace the elk, mountain",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"sheep, antelope, mule deer, the black bear and even the grizzly. No one",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
can say precisely how long those several species were in ascertaining,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
that it was safe to trust themselves within easy rifle-shot of man; but,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
I think it was about five years. Birds recognize protection far more,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
quickly than mammals. In a comparatively short time the naturally wild,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
and wary big game of the Yellowstone Park became about as tame as range,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
cattle. It was at least fifteen years ago that the mule deer began to,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"frequent the parade ground at the Mammoth Hot Springs military post, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
receive there their rations of hay.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Whenever you see a beautiful photograph of a large band of big-horn,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"sheep or mule deer taken at short range amid Rocky Mountain scenery, you",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
are safe in labeling it as having come from the Yellowstone Park. The,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
prong-horned antelope herd is so tame that it is difficult to keep it,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"out of the streets of Gardiner, on the Montana side of the line.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
But the bears! Who has not heard the story of the bears of the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Yellowstone Park,--how black bears and grizzlies stalk out of the woods,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"every day, to the garbage dumping-ground; how black bears actually have",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"come _into the hotels_ for food, without breaking the truce, and how the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"just what they please, because they _know_ that no man dares to shoot",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"them! Indeed, those raiding bears long ago became a public nuisance, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
many of them have been caught in steel box-traps and shipped to,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"zoological gardens, in order to get them out of the way. And yet,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"outside the Park boundaries, everywhere, the bears are as wary and wild",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
as the wildest.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The arrogance of the bears that couldn't be shot once led to a droll,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
and also exciting episode.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"During the period when Mr. C.J. Jones (""Buffalo"" Jones) was",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"superintendent of the wild animals of the Park, the indignities",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
inflicted upon tourist campers by certain grizzly bears quite abraded,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
his nerves. He obtained from Major Pitcher authority to punish and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"reform a certain grizzly, and went about the matter in a thoroughly",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Buffalo-Jonesian manner. He procured a strong lariat and a bean-pole,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
seven feet long and repaired to the camp that was troubled by too much,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
grizzly.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The particular offender was a full-grown male grizzly who had become a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
notorious raider. At the psychological moment Jones lassoed him in short,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

earth. And then his punishment began.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Buffalo Jones thrashed him soundly with the bean-pole! The outraged bear,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"swung to and fro, whirled round and round, clawing and snapping at the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"empty air, roaring and bawling with rage, scourged in flesh and insulted",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"in spirit. As he swung, the bean-pole searched out the different parts",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
of his anatomy with a wonderful degree of neatness and precision.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Between rage and indignation the grizzly nearly exploded. A,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"moving-picture camera was there, and since that day that truly moving",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
scene has amazed and thrilled countless thousands of people.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"When it was over, Mr. Jones boldly turned the bear loose! Although its",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"rage was as boundless as the glories of the Yellowstone Park, it paused",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"not to rend any of those present, but headed for the tall timber, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"with many an indignant ""Woof! Woof!"" it plunged in and disappeared. It",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

impudent grizzly bears.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

And what is the mental attitude of _every_ Rocky Mountain black or,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
My friend J. Alden Loring (one of the naturalists of the Roosevelt,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

  a picture of a part of the pond while the ducks were thickly,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

THE SAVING OF THE SNOWY EGRET IN THE UNITED STATES.--The time was when,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
very many persons believed that the devastations of the plume-hunters,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
of Florida and the Gulf Coast would be so long continued and so,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
persistently followed up to the logical conclusion that both species of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
plume-furnishing egrets would disappear from the avifauna of the United,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"It happened, however, that almost at the last moment a solitary",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"admiration and praise, but also to the higher tribute of practical",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

  to start an artificial rookery of them where they could be,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  thoroughly protected. With this end in view I built a small pond,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"Wyoming, in quest of food at the hands of their natural enemies. The elk",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"surrounded the log-enclosed haystacks, barns and houses, mutely begging",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"for food. Previous to the winter of 1911, thousands of weak calves and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

INTRODUCED SPECIES THAT HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Man has made numerous experiments in the transplantation of wild species,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"of mammals and birds from one country, or continent, to another. About",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"one-half these efforts have been beneficial, and the other half have",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
resulted disastrously.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The transplantation of any wild-animal species is a leap in the dark. On,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"general principles it is dangerous to meddle with the laws of Nature,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
and attempt to improve upon the code of the wilderness. Our best wisdom,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
in such matters may easily prove to be short-sighted folly. The trouble,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
lies in the fact that concerning transplantation it is _impossible for,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"us to know beforehand all the conditions that will affect it, or that it",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"will effect, and how it will work out_. In its own home a species may",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"_seem_ not only harmless, but actually beneficial to man. We do not",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"know, and _we can not know_, all the influences that keep it in check,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"and that mould its character. We do not know, and we can not know",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"without a trial, how new environment will affect it, and what new traits",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
of character it will develop under radically different conditions. The,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
gentle dove of Europe may become the tyrant dove of Cathay. The,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Repressed Rabbit of the Old World becomes in Australia the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
No wild species should be transplanted and set free in a wild state to,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"stock new regions without consulting men of wisdom, and following their",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
advice. It is now against the laws of the United States to introduce and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"acclimatize in a wild state, anywhere in the United States, any",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
wild-bird species without the approval of the Department of Agriculture.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"The law is a wise one. Furthermore, the same principle should apply to",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
birds that it is proposed to transplant from one portion of the United,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"States into another, especially when the two are widely separated.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"On this point, I once learned a valuable lesson, which may well point my",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"A gentlemen of my acquaintance, who admires the European magpie, and is",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"well aware of its acceptable residence in various countries in Europe,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
once requested my cooperation in securing and acclimatizing at his,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"country estate a number of birds of that species. As in duty bound, I",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"laid the matter before our Department of Agriculture, and asked for an",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"opinion. The Department replied, in effect, ""Why import a foreign magpie",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"when we have in the West a species of our own quite as handsome, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"which could more easily be transplanted?""",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"The point seemed well taken. Now, I had seen much of the American",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"magpie in its wild home,--the Rocky Mountains, and the western border",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"of the Great Plains,--and I _thought_ I was acquainted with it. I knew",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"that a few complaints against it had been made, but they had seemed to",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
me very trivial. To me our magpie seemed to have a generally,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
unobjectionable record.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Fortunately for me, I wrote to Mr. Hershey, Assistant Curator of",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Ornithology in the Colorado State Museum, for assistance in procuring",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"fifty birds, for transplantation to the State of New York. Mr. Hershey",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"replied that if I really wished the birds for acclimatization, he would",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
gladly procure them for me; but he said that in the _thickly-settled,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"farming communities_ of Colorado, the magpie is now regarded as a pest.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"It devours the eggs and nestlings of other wild birds, and not only",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"that, it destroys so many eggs of domestic poultry that many farmers are",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
compelled to keep their egg-laying hens shut up in wire enclosures!,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Now, this condition happened to be entirely unknown to me, because I",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
never had seen the American magpie in action _in a farming community_!,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Of course the proposed experiment was promptly abandoned, but it is",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
embarrassing to think how near I came to making a mistake. Even if the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"magpies had been transplanted and had become a nuisance in this state,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
they could easily have been exterminated by shooting; but the memory of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the error would have been humiliating to the party of the first part.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

THE OLD WORLD PHEASANTS IN AMERICA.--In 1881 the first Chinese,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"ring-necked pheasants were introduced into the United States, twelve",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"miles below Portland, Oregon; twelve males and three females. The next",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"year, Oregon gave pheasants a five-year close season. A little later,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the golden and silver pheasants of China were introduced, and all three",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"species throve mightily, on the Pacific Coast, in Oregon, Washington and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"western British Columbia. In 1900, the sportsmen of Portland and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Vancouver were shooting cock golden pheasants according to law.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The success of Chinese and Japanese pheasants on the Pacific Coast soon,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"led to experiments in the more progressive states, at state expense.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"State pheasant hatcheries have been established in Massachusetts,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

California.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"In many localities, the old-world pheasants have come to stay. The rise",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
and progress of the ring-neck in western New York has already been,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
noted. It came about merely through protection. That protection was,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"protection in fact, not the false ""protection"" that shoots on the sly.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
It is the irony of fate that full protection should be accorded a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"foreign bird, in order that it may multiply and possess the land, while",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the same kind of protection is refused the native bob white, and it is",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"now almost a dead species, so far as this state is concerned.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
In looking about for grievances against the ring-necked and English,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"pheasant, some persons have claimed that in winter these birds are",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"""budders,"" which means that they harmfully strip trees and bushes of the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
buds that those bushes will surely need in their spring opening. On,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"that point Dr. Joseph Kalbfus, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Game",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Commission, sent out a circular letter of inquiry, in response to which",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"he received many statements. With but one exception, all the testimony",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"received was to the effect that pheasants are _not_ bud-eaters, and that",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
generally the charge is unfounded.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"supply for the table. The people of this country are not starving, nor",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

experience of the world in the breeding of domestic cattle (_not,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"Leopold Trouvelot, in 1868 or '69. History records the fact that the man",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
of science did not purposely set free the pest. He was endeavoring with,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

THE RABBIT PLAGUE IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND.--The rabbit curse upon,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Australia and New Zealand is so well known as to require little comment.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
In this case the introduction was deliberate. In the days when the sheep,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"that the introduction of the rabbit, and its establishment as a wild",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"food supply, that it would furnish sport, and being unable to harm any",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
other creature of flesh and blood it was therefore harmless.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"In a short time, the immense number of rabbits that began to overrun the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"simple calculation brought out the startling information that, under",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"perfectly favorable conditions, a single pair of rabbits could in three",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"years' time produce progeny amounting to 13,718,000 individuals. Ever",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"since that time, in discussing the rabbits of Australia it has been",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"""The inhabitants of the colony,"" says Dr. Richard Lydekker, ""soon found",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

perfect way to conserve a water supply for a great human population is,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

sincerely hope that by the time the members of the present State Game,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Commission have passed from earth the people of Pennsylvania will have,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"learned the value of the work they are now doing, and at least give them",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the appreciation that is deserved by public-spirited citizens who do,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
large things for the People without hope of material reward. At this,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"moment, Commissioner John M. Phillips and Dr. Joseph Kalbfus are putting",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
their heart's blood into the business of preserving and increasing the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
game and other wild life of Pennsylvania; and the utter lack of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
appreciation that is now being shown _in some quarters_ is really,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
distressing. I refer particularly to the utterly misguided and mistaken,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"body of hunters and anglers having headquarters at Harrisburg, whose",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
members are grossly mislead into a wrong position by a man who seeks to,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
secure a salaried state position through the hostile organization that,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"he has built up, apparently for his own use. In the belief that those",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"members generally are mislead and not mean-spirited, and that the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"organization contains a majority of conscientious sportsmen, I predict",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
that ere long the evil genius of Pennsylvania game protection will be,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"ordered to the rear, while the organization as a whole takes its place",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"on the side of the Game Commission, where it belongs.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The game sanctuary scheme that Pennsylvania has developed is so new that,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
as yet only a very small fraction of the people of that state either,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"understand it, or appreciate its far-reaching importance.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"To begin with, Pennsylvania has acquired up to date about one million",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"acres of forest lands, scattered through 26 of the 67 counties of the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
state. These great holdings are to be gradually increased. These wild,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"lands, including many sterile mountain ""farms"" of no real value for",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"agricultural purposes, have been acquired, first of all, for the purpose",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
of conserving the water supply of the state; and they are called the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
State Forest Reserves.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Next in order, the State Game Commission has created, in favorable",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"localities in the forest reserves, five great game preserves. The plan",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"is decidedly novel and original, but is very simple withal. In the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"center of a great tract of forest reserve, a specially desirable tract",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"has been chosen, and its boundaries marked out by the stringing of a",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"single heavy fence wire, surrounding the entire selection. The area",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
within that boundary wire is an absolute sanctuary for all wild,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"creatures save those that prey upon game, and in it no man may hunt",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"anything, nor fire a gun. The boundary wire is by no means a fence, for",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
it keeps nothing out nor in.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Outside of the wire and the sanctuary, men may hunt in the open season,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
but at the wire every chase must end. If the hunted deer knows enough to,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"flee to the sanctuary when attacked, so much the better for the deer.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"The tide of wild life ebbs and flows under the wire, and beyond a doubt",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the deer and grouse will quickly find that within it lies absolute,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
safety. There the breeding and rearing of young may go on undisturbed.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
In view of the fact that hunting may go on in the forest reserve areas,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"surrounding these sanctuaries, no intelligent sportsman needs to be told",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"that in a few years all such regions will be teeming with deer, grouse",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
and other game. Where there is one deer to-day there will be twenty ten,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"years hence,--because the law of Pennsylvania forbids the killing of",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
does; and then there will be twenty times the legitimate hunting that,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"there is to-day. For example, the Clinton County Game Preserve of 3,200",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"acres is surrounded by 128,000 acres of forest reserve, which form",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
legitimate hunting grounds for the game bred in the sanctuary reservoir.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"was created by Wyoming, in 1904. It is situated along the south of, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"fully adjoining, the Yellowstone Park, and its area is 900 square miles",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"(576,000 acres). Its special purpose is to supplement for the elk herds",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
and other big game the protection from killing that previously had been,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
found in the Yellowstone Park alone. The State Preserve is an admirable,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
half-way house for the migrating herds when they leave the National Park,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
to seek their regular winter ranges in and around the Jackson Valley.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"As now set forth on the map of North America, Canada is a vast country.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"We must no longer think of Ontario and Quebec as ""Canada West"" and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"""Canada East,"" because the new assistant-nation owns and rules",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"everything from Labrador to British Columbia, and all the northern",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
mainland save Alaska.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Although the fauna of Canada is strictly boreal, it is sufficiently",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"dispersed and diversified to demand wise legislation, and plenty of it.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"For a nation with an outfit of provinces so new, Canada already is well",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"advanced in the matter of game laws and game preserves, and in some",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"respects she has set the pace for her southern neighbors. For example,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"in New Brunswick we see the lordly moose successfully hunted for sport,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
not only without being exterminated but actually on a basis that permits,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
it to increase in number. In Nova Scotia we see a law in force _which,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"successfully prohibits the waste of moose meat_, a loss that",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
characterizes moose hunting everywhere else throughout the range of that,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
animal. All over southern Canada the use of automatic shotguns in,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
hunting is strictly prohibited.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"On the other hand, the laws of the Canadians are weak in not preventing",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the sale of all wild game and the killing of antelope. In the matter of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"game-selling, there are far too many open doors, and a sweeping reform",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
is very necessary.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Speaking generally, and with application from Labrador to British",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Columbia, the American process of game extermination according to law is",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
vigorously and successfully being pursued by the people of Canada. The,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"open seasons are too long, and the bag limits are too generous to the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"gunners. As it is elsewhere, the bag-limit laws on birds are a farce,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"because it is impossible to enforce them, save on every tenth man. For",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"example, in his admirable ""Final Report of the Ontario Game and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Fisheries Commission"" (1912), Commissioner Kelly Evans says:",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"""The prairie chicken, which formerly was comparatively plentiful",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"throughout the greater portion of the Rainy River District, has now",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
become practically extinct in that region. Various causes have been,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"assigned for this, but it would seem, as usual, to have been mainly the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"fault of indiscriminate and excessive slaughter."" (Page 226.)",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Like the United States, the various portions of Canada have their",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
various local troubles in wild-life protection. I think the greatest,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"practical difficulties, and the most real opposition to adequate",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"measures, is found in the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario. Is it because",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the French-descended population is impatient of real restraint, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"objects to measures that are drastic, even though they are necessary? In",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Ontario, Commissioner Evans has been splendidly supported by the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Government, and by all the real sportsmen of that province; but the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
gunners and guerrillas of destruction have successfully postponed,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"several of the reforms that he has advocated, and which should have been",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
carried into effect.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
So far as _public_ moral support for game protection is concerned I,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
think that the prairie and mountain provinces have the best of it. In,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Athabasca and British Columbia, the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"spirit of the people is mainly correct, and the chief thing that seems",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
to be lacking is a Kelly Evans in each of those provinces to urge public,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"sentiment into strong action. For example, why should Alberta still",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"permit the hunting and killing of prong-horned antelope, when it is so",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
well known that that species is vanishing like a mist before the morning,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
sun? I think it is because no one seems to have risen up as G.O. Shields,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"did in the United States, to make a big fuss about it, and demand a",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"reform. At any rate, all the provinces of Canada that still possess",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
antelope should _immediately pass laws giving that species absolute,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"close seasons for ten years_. Why neglect it longer, when such neglect",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"is now so very wrong? Whether this is done or not, I sincerely hope that",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"hereafter no true American sportsman, will be guilty of killing one of",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the vanishing antelope of Canada, even though ""the law doth give it.""",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"In the creation of National parks and game preserves, some of the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
provinces of the Canadian nation have displayed a degree of foresight,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
and enterprise that merits sincere admiration. While in different,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"provinces the exact status of these establishments may vary somewhat,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the main purpose of each is the same,--the preservation of the forests",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
and the wild life. In all of them a regulated amount of fishing is,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"permitted, and in some the taking of fur-bearing animals is permitted;",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
but I believe in all the birds and furless mammals are strictly,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"protected. In some parks the carrying of firearms still is permitted,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
but that privilege is quite out of harmony with the spirit and purposes,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"of a game preserve, and should be abolished. If it is necessary to carry",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"firearms through a preserve, as often happens in the Yellowstone Park,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

and thus will temptation be kept out of the way of sinners.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Up to this date I never have seen a publication which set forth in one,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"in the Province, being in fact a game reserve and not a forest reserve;",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
but in the past at least a measure of protection would seem to have been,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"afforded the game in most of the [forest] reserves, owing to the fact",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"that the carrying of firearms therein has been discouraged, and it would",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
appear to require but the passing of an Order-in-Council to render the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
carrying of firearms in all reserves illegal. It is sincerely to be,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"hoped that not only will such action be taken without delay, but also",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

BRITISH COLUMBIA.--This province has made an excellent beginning in the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
creation of game preserves. The first agitation on that subject was,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"begun in 1906, by two sportsmen whose names in connection with it have",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"long since been forgotten. On November 15, 1908, the Legislative Council",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
of British Columbia issued a proclamation that created a very fine game,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"preserve in the East Kootenai District, between the Elk and Bull Rivers",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
and northwestward thereof to the White River country. By an unfortunate,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"oversight, the new preserve never has been officially named, but we may",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
designate it here as,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
_The Elk River Game Preserve_.--This preserve has a total area of about,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"450 square miles, and includes a fine tract of mountains, valleys, lakes",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"and streams. It contained in 1908 about 1,000 mountain goats, 200 sheep,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"a few elk and deer, and about 50 grizzly bears. All these have notably",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
increased during the period of absolute protection that they have,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
enjoyed. It is probable that this preserve contains more white mountain,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
goats than any other preserve that thus far has been made. It was in,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
this region that Mr. John M. Phillips and Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborne,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
made the first mountain goat photographs ever made at close range. It is,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

GAME BREEDING.--The breeding of game in captivity for sale in the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
markets of the world is just as legitimate as the breeding of domestic,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"species. This applies equally to mammals, birds, reptiles and fishes. It",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
is the duty of the nation and the state to foster such industries and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
facilitate the marketing of their products without any unnecessary,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"formalities, delays or losses to producers or to purchasers.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Already this principle has been established in several states. Without,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"going into the records, it is safe to say that Colorado was the pioneer",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"in the so-called ""more-game"" movement, about 1899; but there is one",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
person who would like to have the world believe that it started in the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"state of New York, about 1909. The idea is not quite as ""old as the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"hills,"" but the application of it in the United States dates back",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
through a considerable vista of years.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
The laws of Colorado providing for the creation of private game,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"preserves and the marketing of their product under a tagging system, are",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"very elaborate, and they show a sincere desire to foster an industry as",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
yet but slightly developed in this country. The laws of New York are,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
much more simple and easy to understand than those of Colorado.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
There is one important principle now fully recognized in the New York,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
laws for game breeding that other states will do well to adopt. It is,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the fact that certain kinds of wild game _can not be bred and reared in,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"captivity on a commercial basis_; and this being true, it is clearly",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
against public policy to provide for the sale of any such species. Why,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
provide for the sale of preserve-bred grouse and ducks which we know can,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
not be bred and reared in confinement in marketable numbers? For,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"example, if we may judge by the numerous experiments that _thus far_",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"have been made,--as we certainly have a right to do,--no man can",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"successfully breed and rear in captivity, on a commercial basis, the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"canvasback duck, teal, pintail duck, ruffed grouse or quail. This being",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the case, no amount of clamor from game dealers and their allies ever",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
should induce any state legislature to provide for the sale of any of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
those species _until it has been fully demonstrated_ that they _have,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
been_ and _can be_ bred in captivity in large numbers. The moment the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"markets of a state are thrown open to these impossible species, from",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
that moment the state game wardens must make a continuous struggle to,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
prevent the importation and sale of those birds contrary to law. This,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
proposition is so simple that every honest man can see it.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
All that any state legislature may rightfully be asked to do is to,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"provide for the sale, under tags, of those species which _we know_ can",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"Thousands of busy and burdened men and women are to-day striving hard,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"early and late, to promote measures that will preserve the valuable wild",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
life of the world. They desire to leave to the boys and girls of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
tomorrow a good showing of the marvelous bird and animal forms that make,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the world beautiful and interesting. They are acting on the principle,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"that the wild life of to-day is not ours, to destroy or to keep as we",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"choose, but has been given to us _in trust_, partly for our benefit and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
partly for those who come after us and audit our accounts. They believe,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
that we have no right to squander and destroy a wild-life heritage of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"priceless value which we have done nothing to create, and which is not",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
ours to destroy.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"DUTY OF PARENTS.--This being the case, it is very necessary that the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"young people of to-day should be taught, early and often, the virtue and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
the necessity of wild-life protection. There is no reason that the boy,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"of to-day should not take up his share of the common burden, just as",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
soon as he is old enough to wander alone through the woods. Let him be,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"taught in precise terms that he must _not rob birds' nests_, and that he",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"_must not shoot song-birds, woodpeckers and kingfishers_ with a",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"22-calibre rifle, or any other gun. At this moment there lies upon my",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
side table a vicious little 22-calibre rifle that was taken from two,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"boys who were camping in the woods of Connecticut, and amusing",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
themselves by shooting valuable insectivorous birds. Now those boys were,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
not wholly to blame for what they were doing; but their fathers and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
mothers were _very much to blame_! They should have been taught at the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
parental knee that it is very wrong to kill any bird except a genuine,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"game bird, and then only in the lawful open season. Those two fathers",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
paid $10 each for having failed in their duty; and it served them right;,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
for they were the real culprits.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Small-calibre rifles are becoming alarmingly common in the hands of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
boys. _Parents must do their duty in the training of their boys against,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
bird-shooting!_ It is a very serious matter. A million boys who roam the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"fields with small rifles without having been instructed in protection,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
can destroy an appalling number of valuable birds in the course of a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
year. Some parents are so slavishly devoted to their children that they,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"wish them to do everything they please, and be checked in nothing. Such",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"parents constitute one of the pests of society, and a drag upon the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
happiness of their own children! It is now the bounden duty of each,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
parent to teach each one of his or her children that the time has come,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"when the resources of nature, and especially wild life, must be",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
conserved. To permit boys to grow up and acquire guns without this,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
knowledge is very wrong.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"THE DUTY OF TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS.--A great deal of ""nature study"" is",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

criminal; the extent to which wild birds and mammals return to us and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

THE PHILLIPS EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN FOR THE BIRDS.--Quite recently there,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
has come under my notice an episode in the education of school children,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
that has given the public profound satisfaction. I cite it here as an,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"to-day and the future, would be in teaching school children to love it",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
and protect it. His fertile brain and open check-book soon devised a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
method for his home city. His theory was that by giving the children,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"_something to do_, not only in protecting but in actually _bringing",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"back_ the birds, much might be accomplished.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"on ripening during two months or more, new berries appearing daily while",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
others are ripening. This is why it is such good bird food. Nor is it,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

  as to be present. County Superintendent of Schools Samuel Hamilton,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  was simply a mass of delight. And how could he be otherwise,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  surrounded as he was by 2,000 and more children fairly quivering",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

  Phillips undertook to show them how they could have birds all their,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  own. Being clever in devising schemes for achieving things most to,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  be desired, he began giving out bird-boxes to those who would agree",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  to put them up, and to watch and defend the birds when they came to",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  make their homes with them. And he found that no more faithful,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

  his own.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  Here was the solution to the vexed problem. Provide boxes for those,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  who would agree to put them up, care for the birds, and study their",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  habits and needs. The children agreed at once, and the birds did not",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  object, so Mr. Phillips had some hundreds, four or five, blue-bird",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  and wren boxes constructed during the past winter. These were passed,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  out some weeks ago to any boys or girls who would present an order,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"  it indorsed by his parents, and vouched for by his school principal.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  That he had struck the right scheme was proven by the avidity with,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

THE ETHICS OF SPORTSMANSHIP,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
I count it as rather strange that American and English sportsmen have,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"hunted and shot for a century, and until 1908 formulated practically",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
nothing to establish and define the ethics of shooting game. Here and,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"there, a few unwritten principles have been evolved, and have become",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
fixed by common consent; but the total number of these is very few.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Perhaps this has been for the reason that every free and independent,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"sportsman prefers to be a law unto himself. Is it not doubly strange,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"however, that even down to the present year the term ""sportsmen"" never",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
has been defined by a sportsman!,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Forty years ago, a sportsman might have been defined, according to the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"standards of that period, as a man who hunts wild game for pleasure.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Those were the days wherein no one foresaw the wholesale annihilation of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"species, and there were no wilderness game preserves. In those days,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"gentlemen shot female hoofed game, trapped bears if they felt like it,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"killed ten times as much big game as they could use, and no one made any",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
fuss whatever about the waste or extermination of wild life.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Those were the days of ox-teams and broad-axes. To-day, we are living in",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"a totally different world,--a world of grinding, crunching, pulverizing",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"progress, a world of annihilation of the works of Nature. And what is a",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
sportsman to-day?,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"A SPORTSMAN is a man who loves Nature, and who in the enjoyment of the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
outdoor life and exploration takes a reasonable toll of Nature's wild,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"animals, but not for commercial profit, and only so long as his hunting",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
does not promote the extermination of species.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"In view of the disappearance of wild life all over the habitable globe,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"and the steady extermination of species, the ethics of sportsmanship has",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
become a matter of tremendous importance. If a man can shoot the last,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"living Burchell zebra, or prong-horned antelope, and be a sportsman and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"a gentleman, then we may just as well drop down all bars, and say no",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
more about the ethics of shooting game.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
But the real gentlemen-sportsmen of the world are not insensible to the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
duties of the hour in regard to the taking or not taking of game. The,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"time has come when canon laws should be laid down, of world-wide",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"application, and so thoroughly accepted and promulgated that their",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"binding force can not be ignored. Among other things, it is time for a",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
list of species to be published which no man claiming to be either a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
gentleman or a sportsman can shoot for aught else than preservation in a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"public museum. Of course, this list would be composed of the species",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
that are threatened with extermination. Of American animals it should,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"include the prong-horned antelope, Mexican mountain sheep, all the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"mountain sheep and goats in the United States, the California grizzly",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"bear, mule deer, West Indian seal and California elephant seal and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
walrus.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"In Africa that list should include the eland, white rhinoceros,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"antelope, rhinoceros south of the Zambesi, leucoryx antelope and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

gayal. The David deer of Manchuria already is extinct in a wild state.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Prior to 1908, no effort (so far as we are aware) ever had been made to",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
promote the establishment of a comprehensive and up-to-date code of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
ethics for sportsmen who shoot. A few clubs of men who are hunters of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
big game had expressed in their constitutions a few brief principles for,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"the purpose of standardizing their own respective memberships, but that",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  3. The sale of game is incompatible with the perpetual preservation,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

  overworked men for tramping and camping trips in the wilds; and the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

  outing.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"  least, and leaves behind him no wounded animals.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  13. The killing of an animal means the end of its most interesting,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

  possession.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"  14. The killing of a female hoofed animal, save for special",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  15. A particularly fine photograph of a large wild animal in its,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
  haunts is entitled to more credit than the dead trophy of a similar,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"  animal. An animal that has been photographed never should be killed,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"Throughout sixty years, to go no further back, the people of America",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"have been witnessing the strange spectacle of American zoologists, as a",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

referred to have been conspicuous on the firing line in defense of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"assaulted wild life. In their hearts, we know that in an academic way",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

extermination of species; and we also know that perhaps fifty American,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
I am speaking now of the general body of museum directors and curators;,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
professors and teachers of zoology in our institutions of learning--a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
legion in themselves; teachers of nature study in our secondary schools;,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
investigators and specialists in state and government service; the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"taxidermists and osteologists; and the array of literary people who,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"Taken as a whole, the people named above constitute a grand army of at",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"least five thousand trained, educated, resourceful and influential",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
persons. They all _depend upon wild life for their livelihood_. When,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"they talk about living things, the public listens with respectful",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"laws for the protection of all the game birds, the mammals and the game",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
fishes. When we stop to consider that the game birds alone embrace _154,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"The time was, thirty or forty years ago, when wild life was so abundant",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
that we did not need to worry about its preservation. That was the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

Extermination!_ The questions for every American zoologist and every,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
sportsman to answer now are: Shall the slaughter of species go on to a,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"quick end of the period? Shall we give posterity a birdless, gameless,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

In 1896 the AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY became a center of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"activity in bird protection, and the headquarters of the New York State",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Audubon Society. The president of the Museum (Professor Henry Fairfield,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"In several of the New York State movements for bird conservation,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"been active, and at times conspicuous. No one (so I believe) ever",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
appealed to the President of the Museum for help on the firing line,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

preservation of wild life is not one of the declared objects of the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

There is room for an important improvement in the declared objects of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

"mankind, and who will do their duty as good citizens; and (2) those who",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
from the cradle to the grave meanly and sordidly study their own selfish,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"interests, who never do aught save in expectation of a quick return",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"benefit, and who recognize no such thing as duty toward mankind at",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
large.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"Men and women of the first class are honored in life, mourned when dead,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
and gratefully remembered by posterity. They leave the world better than,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"they found it, and their lives have been successful.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Men and women of the second class are merely so many pieces of animated,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
furniture; and when they pass out the world cares no more than when old,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
chairs are thrown upon the scrap-heap.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"There are many men so selfish, so ignorant and mean of soul that even",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
out of well-filled purses they would not give ten dollars to save the,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
whole bird fauna of North America from annihilation. To all persons of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"that brand, it is useless to appeal. As soon as you find one, waste no",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"time upon him. Get out of his neighborhood as quickly as you can, and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
look for help among real MEN.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"The wild life of the world cannot be saved by a few persons, even though",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
they work their hearts out in the effort. The cause needs two million,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"more helpers; and they must be sought in Group No. 1. They are living,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book

,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
There are times and causes in which the good citizen has no option but,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
to render service. The most important of such causes are: the relief of,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"suffering humanity, the conservation of the resources of nature, and the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
prevention of vandalism. If the American Nation had refused aid to,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"stricken San Francisco, the callous hard-heartedness of it would have",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
shocked the world. If the German army of 1871 had destroyed the art,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"treasures and the libraries of Paris, it would have set the German",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"nation back ten centuries, into the ranks of the lowest barbarians.",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"And yet, in America, and in the regions now being scourged by the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"feather trade, a wonderful FAUNA is being destroyed! It took _millions",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
of years_ to develop that marvelous array of wild life; and when gone,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
_it never can be replaced_! Yet the Army of Destruction is sweeping it,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
away as joyously as a hired laborer cuts down a field of corn.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"That wild life _can_ be saved! If done, it must be done by the men and",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"women of Group No. 1. The means by which it can be saved are: _Money,",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
labor_ and _publicity. Every man of_ ordinary means and intelligence can,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
contribute either money or labor. The men on the firing line must not be,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
expected to furnish their own food and ammunition. The Workers MUST be,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
provided with the money that active campaign work imperatively demands!,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
Those who cannot conveniently or successfully labor should give money,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"to this cause; but at the same time, every good citizen should keep in",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"touch with his lawmaking representatives, and in times of need ask for",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
votes for whatever new laws are necessary.,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"With money enough to arouse the American people in certain ways, the",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
wild life of North America (north of Mexico) can be saved. _Money_ can,Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
"secure labor and publicity, and the People will do the rest. For this",Our Vanishing Wild Life,Our Vanishing Wild Life,book,book
