To solve our greatest challenges we need a 21st century update to scholarly communication. Our mission is to efficiently publish the world's knowledge. We do this through Internet-scale innovation and Open Access licensing to save your time, your money, and to maximize recognition of your contributions. We aim to drive the costs of publishing down for the academic community, while improving the overall publishing experience, and providing authors with a publication venue suitable for the 21st Century.

We have seven peer-reviewed publications: PeerJ â€“ the Journal of Life & Environmental Sciences (PeerJ); PeerJ Computer Science; PeerJ Physical Chemistry; PeerJ Organic Chemistry; PeerJ Inorganic Chemistry; PeerJ Analytical Chemistry and PeerJ Materials Science.

Authors can pay either a low-cost per article publication fee (i.e. APC) or for a lifetime publishing membership, which gives them the ability to publish their articles with us for free. The Q&A + annotations platform provides a second route to recognizing contributions for knowledge-share.

Publishing scholarly research should not cost more than the research project itself, especially in the Internet era.
