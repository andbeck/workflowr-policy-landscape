This is why journal articles and issues are immediately distributed worldwide upon publication, free to read, download and print. We have adopted as default the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 for all publications in any Pensoft journal, meaning that any published work is available for distribution as long as the original publication source is acknowledged.Again in the spirit of open and collaborative research, authors are encouraged to post their work online (e.g., institutional repositories or their websites). Such practices trigger productive exchange, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.
