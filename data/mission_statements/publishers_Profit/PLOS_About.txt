https://plos.org/about/Empowering Researchers to Transform SciencePLOS is a nonprofit, Open Access publisher empowering researchers to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication.We have been breaking boundaries since 2001. We propelled the movement for OA alternatives to subscription journals. We established the first multi-disciplinary publication inclusive of all research regardless of novelty or impact. And we demonstrated the importance of open data availability.To all the researchers practicing Open Science today, thank you for paving the way for future researchers.Leading a Transformation in Science CommunicationThe idea for PLOS began in 2000, when an open letter was circulated by founders Harold Varmus, Patrick Brown and Michael Eisen.Nearly 34,000 scientists from 180 countries signed.Recognizing that most existing journals were resistant to changing their business practices, in 2003 we launched our first fully Open Access journal in order to empower researchers to make science immediately and publicly available online, without restrictions. Our Article Processing Charge model, though revolutionary at the time, would soon pave the way for a new wave of publishing options and ensure the future of Open Access....we will publish in, edit and review for, and personally subscribe to only those scholarly and scientific journals that have agreed to grant unrestricted free distribution rights to any and all original research reports.Our goals have not changedBreak BoundariesTo advance research faster, share more broadly, and increase collaborationEmpower ResearchersTo transform science through inclusivity, choice, credit, and transparencyRedefine QualityTo assess and communicate the full arc of research more fairly and accuratelyOpen ScienceTo build a foundation of knowledge from which we all advance
