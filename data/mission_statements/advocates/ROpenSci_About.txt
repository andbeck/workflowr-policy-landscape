rOpenSci fosters a culture that values open and reproducible research using shared data and reusable software

We do this by
Creating technical infrastructure in the form of carefully vetted, staff and community-contributed R software tools that lower barriers to working with scientific data sources on the web

Making the right data, tools and best practices more discoverable

Creating social infrastructure through a welcoming and diverse community

Promoting advocacy for a culture of data sharing and reusable software

Building capacity of software users and developers and fostering a sense of pride in their work
