The Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), founded by the Ministry of Education (MEC), plays a fundamental role in the expansion and consolidation of stricto sensu postgraduate courses (masters and doctoral degrees) in all states of the Brazilian Federation. In 2007, it also started to work in the training of basic education teachers, expanding the scope of its actions in the training of qualified personnel, in Brazil and abroad. CAPES activities are grouped into the following lines of action, each developed by a structured set of programs: evaluation of stricto sensu postgraduate studies; access and dissemination of scientific production; investments in the training of high-level human resources, in the country and abroad; promotion of international scientific cooperation; induction and promotion of initial and continuing professor training for basic education in classroom and in distance platforms. CAPES has been decisive for the successes achieved by the national graduate system, both in terms of consolidating the current situation, and in building the changes that the advancement of knowledge and the demands of society require. The evaluation system, continuously improved, serves as an instrument for the university community in the search for a standard of academic excellence for national masters and doctorates. The evaluation results serve as a basis for formulating policies for the postgraduate area, as well as for the dimensioning of development actions (scholarships, grants, support).
