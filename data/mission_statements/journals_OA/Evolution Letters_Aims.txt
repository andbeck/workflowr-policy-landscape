Papers should demand rapid publication because they substantially advance the field, are of outstanding clarity and originality, or are of broad interest. Papers that introduce new analytical or methodological frameworks that are likely to be highly influential will also be considered. We expect our papers to be able to convey the findings succinctly and accessibly - typically in 5000 words or less. Longer or highly technical papers may be better suited to a different journal.Evolution Letters is jointly owned by the European Society of Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) and the Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE). Profits from the journal are invested back into the two societies. The journal is online only and entirely open access. The journal has a flexible approach to the format of manuscripts on submission, and will only ask authors to adhere to a house style (see Instructions for Authors) once the manuscript is accepted for publication.
