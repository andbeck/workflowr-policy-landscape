It considers articles in the Biological Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Medical Sciences, and Health Sciences.PeerJ does not publish in the Physical Sciences, the Mathematical Sciences, the Social Sciences, or the Humanities (except where articles in those areas have clear applicability to the core areas of Biological, Environmental, Medical or Health sciences).PeerJ only considers Research Articles and Literature Review Articles. It does not accept Hypothesis Papers, Commentaries, Opinion Pieces, Case Studies, Case Reports etc.PeerJ evaluates articles based only on an objective determination of scientific and methodological soundness, not on subjective determinations of 'impact,' 'novelty' or 'interest'.PeerJ applies the highest standards to everything it does - specifically, the publication places an emphasis on research integrity; high ethical standards; constructive peer-review; exemplary production quality; and leading-edge online functionality.PeerJ does not accept pre-submission inquiries; if you are unsure whether or not your article meets our requirements for a particular submission type, please see our discipline standards.PeerJ reserves the right to decline to consider, or publish, any submissions for any reason. This can include those studies that do not have a grounding in established scientific knowledge, or that conflict with the PeerJ's core values.
