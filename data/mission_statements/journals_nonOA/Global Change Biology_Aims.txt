Studies must concern biological systems, regardless of whether they are aquatic or terrestrial, and managed or natural environments. Both biological responses and feedbacks to change are included, and may be considered at any level of organization from molecular to biome. Studies may employ theoretical, modeling, analytical, experimental, observational, and historical approaches and should be exploratory rather than confirmatory. GCB publishes primary research articles, technical advances, research reviews, commentaries and letters.Global Change Biology defines global change as any consistent trend in the environment - past, present or projected - that affects a substantial part of the globe. Examples include:rising tropospheric ozone, carbon dioxide and sulphur xdioxide concentrationsincreasing UV-B irradiationglobal climate changebiological sinks and sources of atmospheric trace gaseseutrophicationland use changeloss of biodiversitybiological feedback on climate changebiological mitigation for atmospheric changeAll manuscripts relating to aspects of biofuel production from forestry, crop production, enzymatic deconstruction and microbial fuel synthesis to implications for biodiversity, ecosystem services, economics, policy and global change should be submitted to GCB Bioenergy, a new sister journal of Global Change Biology.  These will no longer be considered for publication in Global Change Biology.
