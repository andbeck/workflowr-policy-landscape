Trends in Ecology & Evolution (TREE) contains polished, concise and readable reviews, opinions and letters in all areas of ecology and evolutionary science. It serves as an invaluable source of information for researchers, lecturers, teachers, field workers and students. Trends in Ecology & Evolution keeps these scientists informed of new developments and ideas across the full range of ecology and evolutionary biology - from the pure to the applied, and from molecular to global. Now, more than ever before, is it necessary for life scientists to be aware of research from a wide range of disciplines, especially in the face of the gathering momentum of global environmental change and destruction. More than any other journal, Trends in Ecology & Evolution is the major forum for coverage of all the important issues concerning organisms and their environments.Articles for Trends in Ecology & Evolution are a mix of those commissioned by the Editor and ideas from the authors. Prospective authors should submit a Proposal as outlined at https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/presubmission by email to the Editor, Andrea Stephens (tree@cell.com). The submission of completed manuscripts without prior consultation with the Editor is strongly discouraged. Authors should note that all major articles in TREE are peer-reviewed and publication cannot be guaranteed.
