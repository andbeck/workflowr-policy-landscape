Roundtables, forums, and viewpoint articles offer the perspectives of opinion leaders and invite further commentary.Occasional special sections in BioScience provide an in-depth look at important topics. Recent special sections have addressed ecological boundaries, protected areas, acid rain, science and public policy, the US Long Term Ecological Research network, and agricultural bioterrorism.BioScience's precursor, AIBS Bulletin, was published until 1964. AIBS Bulletin content is available via the BioScience website.
