We welcome manuscripts presenting significant, original empirical studies and theoretical investigations that broaden understanding of evolutionary phenomena and processes at all levels of biological organization. We welcome submissions in fields that are regularly featured in the journal and are also expanding our coverage in evolutionary genomics, molecular evolution and quantitative genetics.
