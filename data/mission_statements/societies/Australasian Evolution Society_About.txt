The Australasian Evolution Society is a learned society founded in 1999. We are devoted to bringing evolutionary biologists together to promote intellectual exchange and to foster and advance evolutionary biology.Our Mission is to promote the scientific study of evolution, the discussion of the scientific findings of its members, and their dissemination to the wider public.Our main event is our Annual Conference, where evolutionary biologists come together from across Australasia to present and discuss the latest findings in evolutionary research.
