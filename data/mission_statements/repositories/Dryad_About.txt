https://datadryad.org/stash/our_mission#communityThe Dryad Digital Repository is a curated resource that makes research data discoverable, freely reusable, and citable. Dryad provides a general-purpose home for a wide diversity of data types.Dryad originated from an initiative among a group of leading journals and scientific societies to adopt a joint data archiving policy (JDAP) for their publications, and the recognition that open, easy-to-use, not-for-profit, community-governed data infrastructure was needed to support such a policy. These remain our guiding principles.Dryad’s vision is to promote a world where research data is openly available, integrated with the scholarly literature, and routinely re-used to create knowledge.Our mission is to provide the infrastructure for, and promote the re-use of, data underlying the scholarly literature.Key featuresFlexible about data format, while encouraging the use and further development of research community standards.Fits into the manuscript submission workflow of its partner journals, making data submission easy.Assigns Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to data so that researchers can gain professional credit through data citation.Promotes data visibility through usage and download metrics and by allowing content to be indexed, searched and retrieved.Promotes data quality by employing professional curators to ensure the validity of the files and descriptive information.Contents are free to download and re-use under a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license.Contents are preserved for the long term to guarantee access to contents indefinitely.Open source, standards-compliant technology.
