The Data Centre is committed to the free and open exchange of scientific data, consistent with the Antarctic Treaty's position that "to the greatest extent feasible and practicable scientific observations and results from Antarctica shall be exchanged and made freely available".The AADC team blends data management and scientific domain expertise with skills in computing, application development, geographic information systems, modelling, and statistical analyses. We work collaboratively with national and international centres, networks, and scientists, providing data management and analysis services as well as actively engaging in scientific research. As Australia's Antarctic Mapping agency, the AADC also supports the logistical operations of the Australian Antarctic Program.Data held in the AADC are qualified with metadata and discoverable through the Catalogue of Australian Antarctic and Subantarctic Metadata (CAASM). Some data are also delivered through customised applications on the AADC website. Data delivery systems, where appropriate, use international standards for data exchange and data discovery.AADC staff assist in the capture of data at sea and on land, organise satellite tasking to support science campaigns, and provide advice on data collection methods.
