# Creating Figure 2A

Figure 2A shows gamma values (x-axis, means Â± sd) that are the strength of association between a set of stakeholder documents (y-axis) and the corresponding topic. 

High gamma values are strong associations. 

We plotted the values for four main topics (side labels): Open Research (green), Community and Support (red), Innovation and Solutions (yellow) and Publication Process (blue). 

The data for this are produced in `2_Topic_modeling`
